Another replica of a saint
Drinks the cup of denial
I've felt the earth shake
With thoughts of you

Scrape your knees, as you kneel
As your king smashes your skull

I see your flaws
One winged beauty
Bleeding on the cross
Can you save me?

Another replica of a dog
Bites the hand of justice
I've seen your world choke

By my hands
By my fucking hands
