The Vatican should be separate from Byzantium


[01-Sep-20 05:45 AM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
At least in that


[01-Sep-20 06:43 AM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
I disagree.


[01-Sep-20 06:48 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
Me and Pius's reasoning behind this that we discussed


[01-Sep-20 06:49 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
is the position of Patriarch of Rome is not to become a political status symbol, but a reasonability


[01-Sep-20 06:49 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
The representative of all Catholics in the Empire is to be chosen wisely by the Emperor


[01-Sep-20 06:49 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I just want to have a definitive answer.


[01-Sep-20 06:50 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Does the Patriarch or the Secretary have more power?


[01-Sep-20 06:50 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
The Patriarch has more religious power, and the Secretary has more administrative power


[01-Sep-20 06:51 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Alrighty


[01-Sep-20 06:51 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I shall run for Secretary rather than Pope then


[01-Sep-20 06:54 AM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
Then it is settled


[01-Sep-20 06:57 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I have heard both sides of the debate, and found a fix for this that will please everyone


[01-Sep-20 06:57 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
Making an announcement soon


[01-Sep-20 06:58 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
Pope will be elected once more


[01-Sep-20 06:58 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and @Keanu Reeves it will hold more power in the RP, but not outside the RP


[01-Sep-20 06:58 AM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
Hmm


[01-Sep-20 06:58 AM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
Ah


[01-Sep-20 06:59 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
The Pope?


[01-Sep-20 06:59 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Will hold more power?


[01-Sep-20 06:59 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Administrative Power?


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
only in RP


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Because that's the power I am looking for


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
basically not in crusades


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I am looking for administrative powers


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
RP or non RP?


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Both?


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
As much as I can get


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
You see I am a little bit of a megalomaniac


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
So as much power as possible


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
> As much as I can get
@Keanu Reeves  sounds um pretty power hungry 😬


[01-Sep-20 07:00 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
> You see I am a little bit of a megalomaniac


[01-Sep-20 07:01 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and this is why I did not want the religious leader of the catholics in the empire to be elected


[01-Sep-20 07:01 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Like irl


[01-Sep-20 07:01 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I am not even joking


[01-Sep-20 07:01 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I'm just gonna run for Secretary


[01-Sep-20 07:01 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925
FJ can run for Pope if he wants to


[01-Sep-20 07:01 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
well, I did make a victory stele after winning a water baloon fight a while back


[01-Sep-20 07:01 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
by piling rocks


[01-Sep-20 07:02 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and making a chi-rho out of sticks


[01-Sep-20 07:02 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
at a park


[01-Sep-20 07:02 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
it was glorious


[01-Sep-20 07:02 AM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867

Hello


[03-Sep-20 08:22 PM] King Edward I#2029
I strongly believe that your eminences, should vote for me. I am aware that the papal vote is nearing a close, but please if you can, reconsider your vote. I have some electoral promises if I become pope. If I become pope, I will help make clergy reforms in and out of the Papal States. I will fill the pockets of the papal treasury, so we can give bigger loans, fueling the papal economy. Each server that wants, they can apply for a church, with a bishop sent from the Papal States.


[03-Sep-20 08:22 PM] MEE6#4876
Congratulations @King Edward I, you just advanced to level 11. Ave Maria!

I don’t have that role somehow


[03-Sep-20 08:58 PM] King Edward I#2029
Please vote for a cardinal that actually has promises to the people, versus @𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟’s lack of one


[03-Sep-20 08:59 PM] superioroberto#8726
if you win whatever you do don’t purge the fucking fascists again


[03-Sep-20 08:59 PM] King Edward I#2029
I ask that @☩The Server Owner☩ Extend the voting time for another 12 hours, so all the cardinals can view my promises and make a more educated vote.


[03-Sep-20 09:00 PM] superioroberto#8726
the vote has been the same 1-6 for the past 3 days, nothing will change


[03-Sep-20 09:00 PM] King Edward I#2029
I promise I won’t purge the fascists without your permission Roberto


[03-Sep-20 09:00 PM] superioroberto#8726

[03-Sep-20 09:00 PM] King Edward I#2029
Thank you very much, Roberto


[03-Sep-20 09:01 PM] King Edward I#2029
May you reign for all time


[03-Sep-20 09:02 PM] King Edward I#2029
I will just put my promises up again

[03-Sep-20 09:28 PM] King Edward I#2029
And if you are running just for the sake of running, you will lose to people who are running for a purpose


[03-Sep-20 09:29 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015

We need a map of the papal state


[03-Sep-20 09:38 PM] King Edward I#2029
The treasury can also be used to pay mercenary armies

we will do the main re organization after the reforms but after that you can manage it

Hm


[04-Sep-20 10:48 AM] King Edward I#2029
The history of the server reforms?


[04-Sep-20 10:48 AM] King Edward I#2029
Or in general, because I want to get the clergy to actually know what they need to do

[04-Sep-20 09:39 PM] King Edward I#2029
I believe so


[04-Sep-20 09:39 PM] King Edward I#2029
But that’s not within our jurisdiction


[04-Sep-20 09:39 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
Yes


[04-Sep-20 09:40 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
We should


[04-Sep-20 09:40 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
We should


[04-Sep-20 09:40 PM] King Edward I#2029
We can, however, block extremists from taking clergy roles


[04-Sep-20 09:40 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
That is good


[04-Sep-20 09:41 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661

[04-Sep-20 09:41 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
I mean


[04-Sep-20 09:41 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
last time we had fascists here we almost got couped


[04-Sep-20 09:42 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Or we can just ban extremist parties


[04-Sep-20 09:42 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
Yes


[04-Sep-20 09:42 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
But they can work secretly


[04-Sep-20 09:42 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
So it is better banning them


[04-Sep-20 09:42 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Yes


[04-Sep-20 09:43 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015

[04-Sep-20 09:44 PM] King Edward I#2029

@King Edward I Can you give ban powers?


[04-Sep-20 09:49 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
Or tell someone who cans


[04-Sep-20 09:49 PM] King Edward I#2029
Look, my power is limited to the clergy


[04-Sep-20 09:50 PM] King Edward I#2029
I can’t do anything outside of that without the patriarch of Rome consenting


[04-Sep-20 09:50 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
Tell him


[04-Sep-20 09:50 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
or tell Roberto


[04-Sep-20 09:51 PM] King Edward I#2029

Look


[04-Sep-20 09:54 PM] King Edward I#2029
What matters to you all, is that we talk about the re organization of the entire clergy


[04-Sep-20 09:55 PM] King Edward I#2029
With permission of the basalius, We will get every clergy man to be educated on what they do


[04-Sep-20 09:55 PM] superioroberto#8726
yhea


[04-Sep-20 09:56 PM] King Edward I#2029
If someone does not know how to work their role, they will have their role striped until he gets it back


[04-Sep-20 09:56 PM] King Edward I#2029
Through education


[04-Sep-20 09:56 PM] King Edward I#2029

[04-Sep-20 10:04 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
monetary profit?


[04-Sep-20 10:04 PM] King Edward I#2029
Indeed


[04-Sep-20 10:05 PM] King Edward I#2029
Using dank memer coins, we can ask for donations to the church like irl


[04-Sep-20 10:05 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
> Indeed
@King Edward I Wait,that's ilegal


[04-Sep-20 10:05 PM] King Edward I#2029
If we make enough churches in enough servers, we can get donations


[04-Sep-20 10:06 PM] King Edward I#2029
So much so, that we can afford to pay mercenaries


[04-Sep-20 10:06 PM] King Edward I#2029
To go to war with heathens


[04-Sep-20 10:06 PM] King Edward I#2029
Etc


[04-Sep-20 10:06 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
Eh


[04-Sep-20 10:06 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
The Basileus doesn't like pvp wars


[04-Sep-20 10:06 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
except on minetest


[04-Sep-20 10:07 PM] King Edward I#2029
Well, we can also use the money to loan people


[04-Sep-20 10:07 PM] King Edward I#2029
Because I doubt that we have 5,000,000 Dank Memer Coins


[04-Sep-20 10:08 PM] King Edward I#2029
Yeah no


[04-Sep-20 10:08 PM] King Edward I#2029
So that’s a plus if we have money to do things


[04-Sep-20 10:10 PM] King Edward I#2029
If we have money, we can buy channels


[04-Sep-20 10:10 PM] King Edward I#2029
For churches

@Basileus Alexios VI Apokios We need permission for this, will you allow it?


[05-Sep-20 04:22 PM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
We do not need permission as it is a clerical issues not a political one. Therefore you still may do it as you still have your power over the clergy.


[05-Sep-20 04:23 PM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
Or at least that is how I have understood it.


[05-Sep-20 04:24 PM] King Edward I#2029
Hm


[05-Sep-20 04:24 PM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
I would go ahead with it.


[05-Sep-20 04:24 PM] King Edward I#2029
I will make a new role for all the clergy


[05-Sep-20 04:24 PM] King Edward I#2029

be more lenient on the people of the lower roles all the way up to the nuns


[05-Sep-20 04:37 PM] King Edward I#2029
Not demoted, you can get all your roles back once you finish the re education


[05-Sep-20 04:37 PM] superioroberto#8726
as they generally don’t have as much responsibility


[05-Sep-20 04:37 PM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
The clergy need to educated @superioroberto even if they are just a lowly priest.


[05-Sep-20 04:38 PM] KPIBM#3825
Uh huh, and what is this "re-education" about


[05-Sep-20 04:38 PM] superioroberto#8726
no they will still need to be “educated” just not to a greater extent

[05-Sep-20 04:38 PM] King Edward I#2029
It’s not Nazi propaganda, you will need to be educated in what your duties are


[05-Sep-20 04:38 PM] superioroberto#8726
yeah ofc


[05-Sep-20 04:39 PM] superioroberto#8726
but what i mean is try to emphasize re education on the bishops and the top roles


[05-Sep-20 04:39 PM] King Edward I#2029
Yes I know


[05-Sep-20 04:39 PM] superioroberto#8726
“Re educate” the lowly ones too ofc but don’t spend as much time
