Yes


[06-Sep-20 06:48 PM] King Edward I#2029
Once you are done writing them down, make a summary of jesus's life in 4 sentences. This will be graded, and will count to your overall score.


[06-Sep-20 06:48 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
@King Edward I Why is this called classroom if we only take tests?

[07-Sep-20 10:08 PM] King Edward I#2029
@Azrue


[07-Sep-20 10:08 PM] Azrue#5842
Hello im here, sir


[07-Sep-20 10:08 PM] King Edward I#2029
Let’s learn some theology


[07-Sep-20 10:09 PM] King Edward I#2029
Firstly, let’s review some of the core teachings of Jesus


[07-Sep-20 10:09 PM] Francinee#3469
just in time


[07-Sep-20 10:09 PM] King Edward I#2029
Jesus, firstly was the son of god.


[07-Sep-20 10:10 PM] King Edward I#2029
He was born, from the womb of the Virgin Mary.


[07-Sep-20 10:10 PM] Azrue#5842
Uhm


[07-Sep-20 10:12 PM] King Edward I#2029
Jesus has an early story of his early life, where he is in the temple of Jerusalem


[07-Sep-20 10:13 PM] Azrue#5842
Ok


[07-Sep-20 10:13 PM] King Edward I#2029
Jesus goes into the temple


[07-Sep-20 10:14 PM] King Edward I#2029
With Mary and Joseph


[07-Sep-20 10:15 PM] King Edward I#2029
Mary and Joseph, thought they were leaving Jerusalem with little Jesus


[07-Sep-20 10:15 PM] King Edward I#2029
But Jesus stayed with the rabbis of the temple, learning of god


[07-Sep-20 10:17 PM] King Edward I#2029
When Mary and Joseph


[07-Sep-20 10:18 PM] King Edward I#2029
Find that Jesus was not with them, they rush back to the temple


[07-Sep-20 10:18 PM] King Edward I#2029
Jesus is there with the rabbis, learning about god


[07-Sep-20 10:20 PM] King Edward I#2029
The lesson here is to take initiative in learning more about god


[07-Sep-20 10:20 PM] Azrue#5842
Alright


[07-Sep-20 10:20 PM] King Edward I#2029
Now let’s review some prayers


[07-Sep-20 10:21 PM] King Edward I#2029
Tell me the our father, Hail Mary, and glory be.


[07-Sep-20 10:22 PM] Azrue#5842
Our Father, Hail Mary and Glory be.


[07-Sep-20 10:23 PM] King Edward I#2029

[07-Sep-20 10:23 PM] King Edward I#2029
They are the names of prayers


[07-Sep-20 10:23 PM] Azrue#5842

Hallowed be Thy Name. 
Thy Kingdom come. 
Thy Will be done, 
on earth as it is in Heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our trespasses, 
as we forgive those who trespass against us. 
And lead us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

Bruh


[07-Sep-20 10:44 PM] King Edward I#2029
It’s the idea that Mary, mother of god, was free from sin her entire life, and that her life was made for Jesus to learn from her.


[07-Sep-20 10:45 PM] King Edward I#2029
Take note of that


[07-Sep-20 10:47 PM] King Edward I#2029

David was the youngest of Jesse's twelve sons. One day, the nation of Israel was called to fight the Philistine army that had gathered for war. While David's brothers went to fight, young David stayed back. The two armies gathered to stand on opposite sides of a deep valley.  A great Philistine giant named Goliath that stood at over nine feet tall came to the front of the Philistine battle line each day for forty days and mocked the Israelites and their God. Goliath called to them to fight but King Saul and the Israelite were scared and did nothing.


[09-Sep-20 12:19 PM] King Edward I#2029
David was sent by his dad Jesse to visit the front lines and bring back battle news from his brothers. David heard Goliath mocking Israel and their God. David was brave and volunteered to fight Goliath. He persuaded King Saul to let him go fight and decided to not wear any of King Saul's armor. David carried his sling and gathered five smooth stones. Goliath laughed at David but David responded that even though Goliath had a sword and spear, he came in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel. David put a rock in his sling and swung one of the rocks at Goliath's head. The rock sank into the giant's forehead and he fell. David then picked up Goliath's sword and used it to kill Goliath and cut off his head. 

The Philistines turned and ran when they saw their giant hero killed. Israel had won the battle because of a boy who had faith and trusting God! Read the full Bible story of David and Goliath in the Scripture below and find further study help and summaries for this wonderful account of faith and God's provision!

According to Catholic tradition, the history of the Catholic Church begins with Jesus Christ and his teachings and the Catholic Church is a continuation of the early Christian community established by the Disciples of Jesus. The Church considers its bishops to be the successors of the apostles of Jesus and the leader of the Church, the Bishop of Rome (also known as the Pope), the only successor to Saint Peter who ministered in Rome in the 1st century AD. After his appointment by Jesus as head of the Church. At the end of the second century, bishops began to congregate in regional synods to resolve doctrinal and political questions. In the 3rd century, the bishop of Rome began to act as a court of appeal for problems that other bishops could not solve.

***According to Catholic tradition, the history of the Catholic Church begins with Jesus Christ and his teachings and the Catholic Church is a continuation of the early Christian community established by the Disciples of Jesus. The Church considers its bishops to be the successors of the apostles of Jesus and the leader of the Church, the Bishop of Rome (also known as the Pope), the only successor to Saint Peter who ministered in Rome in the 1st century AD. After his appointment by Jesus as head of the Church. At the end of the second century, bishops began to congregate in regional synods to resolve doctrinal and political questions. In the 3rd century, the bishop of Rome began to act as a court of appeal for problems that other bishops could not solve.***

**1. Who are the successors to the control of Christendom?
The Bishop of Rome, and soon enough the reincarnation of Christ as the son of man.
2. What does he mean by the Church being the continuity of the community of disciples and followers of Jesus?
This means spreading the good news of Christianity and spreading the faith and belief and eliminating heretics.
3. Who was the first Pope?
Saint Peter.**

[11-Sep-20 01:23 PM] King Edward I#2029
We are using the classroom instead of letting it die


[11-Sep-20 01:23 PM] King Edward I#2029
Also, no one likes school, but they still have to do it


[11-Sep-20 01:23 PM] superioroberto#8726
it can be used for other purposes, like teaching the new people


[11-Sep-20 01:23 PM] superioroberto#8726
what we’re doing now won’t work


[11-Sep-20 01:23 PM] Foliamane#3308

[11-Sep-20 01:24 PM] King Edward I#2029
No disrespect, but @𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟 is learning like a lot of other students


[11-Sep-20 01:24 PM] King Edward I#2029
He was a cardinal who didn’t know how confessions worked!


[11-Sep-20 01:24 PM] superioroberto#8726
he was a “cardinal” on a discord server


[11-Sep-20 01:25 PM] Foliamane#3308
congratulation that's one out of how many


[11-Sep-20 01:25 PM] King Edward I#2029
Look, if it fails, I’ll let you switch up the curriculum, but you haven’t seen the rest of the work.


[11-Sep-20 01:25 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
Edward, these better not make people reject the bigger reforms


[11-Sep-20 01:25 PM] King Edward I#2029
It’s fine


[11-Sep-20 01:26 PM] Foliamane#3308
I'm already rejecting these


[11-Sep-20 01:26 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
^^^


[11-Sep-20 01:26 PM] superioroberto#8726
I want to see some real progress or im gonna reverse these reforms


[11-Sep-20 01:26 PM] King Edward I#2029
Conservatives will be conservatives, and liberals will be liberals


[11-Sep-20 01:26 PM] King Edward I#2029
I just need time to complete my reforms


[11-Sep-20 01:26 PM] superioroberto#8726
they’re already off to a terrible start


[11-Sep-20 01:26 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
this is why they are taking me so long...


[11-Sep-20 01:27 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I am not going to just do them halfway like you guys


[11-Sep-20 01:27 PM] King Edward I#2029
I need time to teach, make tests, and homework


[11-Sep-20 01:27 PM] superioroberto#8726
teach to an uninterested class about something on a discord server


[11-Sep-20 01:27 PM] MEE6#4876
Congratulations @superioroberto, you just advanced to level 13. Ave Maria!


[11-Sep-20 01:27 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
best you can do is make tests for when the permenant reforms are coming


[11-Sep-20 01:27 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
as these are temporary


[11-Sep-20 01:27 PM] King Edward I#2029
It’s not completely terrible if a stubborn fat bird doesn’t like it


[11-Sep-20 01:27 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the good parts will be integrated into the permenant reforms though


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] King Edward I#2029
Look


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] King Edward I#2029
Im working on it


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
ok


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] superioroberto#8726
> It’s not completely terrible if a stubborn fat bird doesn’t like it
@King Edward I  it’s not that people don’t like it, what’s worse is that people are uninterested


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] Foliamane#3308
or at least just make "tests" for those who had just started, not for those who have been mods for so long


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] King Edward I#2029
People will be interested when they get their first role back


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] superioroberto#8726
id rather someone not like it and show up then not show up at all


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
just do not want backlash when the big reforms come


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] King Edward I#2029
Look


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] King Edward I#2029
Give me the chance to finish it


[11-Sep-20 01:28 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
ok


[11-Sep-20 01:29 PM] King Edward I#2029
I’ll work on the complaints and see if I can fix it


[11-Sep-20 01:29 PM] King Edward I#2029
I need time


[11-Sep-20 01:29 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
this is why I seperated the irl style clergy and the RP clergy


[11-Sep-20 01:29 PM] Foliamane#3308
just give me dean of cardinals back and i'll help you


[11-Sep-20 01:29 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[11-Sep-20 01:29 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[11-Sep-20 01:29 PM] King Edward I#2029

[11-Sep-20 01:30 PM] King Edward I#2029

[11-Sep-20 01:30 PM] Foliamane#3308
thank you


[11-Sep-20 01:30 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the staff roles will not be considered clergy but a secular rank in the full reforms


[11-Sep-20 01:30 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
to prevent stuff like this


[11-Sep-20 01:31 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
people becoming clergy just to get perms


[11-Sep-20 01:31 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and jamming up the classrooms


[11-Sep-20 01:31 PM] King Edward I#2029
