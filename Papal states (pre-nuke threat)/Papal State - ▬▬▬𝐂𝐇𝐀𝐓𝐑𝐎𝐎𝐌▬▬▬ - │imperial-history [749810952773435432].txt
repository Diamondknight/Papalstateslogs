In 2014 the Empire of the Romans began as a small faction on a factions server in a game called theblockheads


[30-Aug-20 09:37 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
will pull up first recorded mention of it


[30-Aug-20 09:38 PM] g r e g#4851
Hmm


[30-Aug-20 09:38 PM] g r e g#4851
The block heads


[30-Aug-20 09:38 PM] g r e g#4851

[30-Aug-20 09:39 PM] g r e g#4851
Ok


[30-Aug-20 09:39 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
that "brigade" in 2014


[30-Aug-20 09:39 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
eventually became the Empire


[30-Aug-20 09:39 PM] g r e g#4851
what is that brigade doe?


[30-Aug-20 09:39 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
It was first called ```the navy```


[30-Aug-20 09:39 PM] g r e g#4851

[30-Aug-20 09:40 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
Back in those days I was in middle school (I am graduated now)


[30-Aug-20 09:40 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
It was before jetpacks and titanium were added to theblockheads

[30-Aug-20 09:41 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
The first war I ever fought:


[30-Aug-20 09:41 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
Cove war I


[30-Aug-20 09:41 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
There was a warrior named candynestea, who mistaked my faction for a similarly named one


[30-Aug-20 09:41 PM] g r e g#4851
How does these wars work? Do you like fight another faction?


[30-Aug-20 09:41 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
pvp


[30-Aug-20 09:42 PM] g r e g#4851
Basically yes lul


[30-Aug-20 09:42 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
she went to my "cobblestone" (named stone ingame but basically cobblestone) castle and started attacking me


[30-Aug-20 09:42 PM] g r e g#4851
Mkay


[30-Aug-20 09:42 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
since she was an admin I was afraid to fight back


[30-Aug-20 09:43 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so I went into a panic room I made out of tough blocks


[30-Aug-20 09:43 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
in the battle I was told by the owner I could attack staff


[30-Aug-20 09:43 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
as they played like normal players


[30-Aug-20 09:43 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I lost the battle though as she had good gear


[30-Aug-20 09:43 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and we were just a noob faction back then


[30-Aug-20 09:43 PM] g r e g#4851
Wait but she couldve Abused her powers and banned you no?


[30-Aug-20 09:43 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
no


[30-Aug-20 09:44 PM] g r e g#4851
üòÖ


[30-Aug-20 09:44 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
It was a misunderstanding about the position of staff


[30-Aug-20 09:44 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
she was playing as intended, being able to pvp


[30-Aug-20 09:44 PM] g r e g#4851
Mhm


[30-Aug-20 09:44 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
if she banned people unfairly she knew she would get fired


[30-Aug-20 09:44 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[30-Aug-20 09:45 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the war went on, and I was on a wooden ship build I made as a base


[30-Aug-20 09:45 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
she proceeded to sail over and burned it down, so I fled


[30-Aug-20 09:45 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
(sorry there is not a lot of details, this was happened in the prehistory period)


[30-Aug-20 09:46 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
(more details will be in the history books when they are finished though)


[30-Aug-20 09:46 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
over time my teammates went inactive


[30-Aug-20 09:46 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so I allied the most powerful tribe on the server


[30-Aug-20 09:46 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
The Atlanteen navy


[30-Aug-20 09:47 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[30-Aug-20 09:48 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and TJ (their cheiftain) took me to his secret lava base


[30-Aug-20 09:48 PM] g r e g#4851

[30-Aug-20 09:48 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[30-Aug-20 09:48 PM] g r e g#4851
Oh ok


[30-Aug-20 09:48 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
a misunderstanding broke out, as I was like, in middle school and dumber then I was now


[30-Aug-20 09:48 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and I got warred and kicked out of the lava base


[30-Aug-20 09:48 PM] g r e g#4851

[30-Aug-20 09:49 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

My discord nation is OLD


[30-Aug-20 09:49 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
was around just a little bit even before discord came out I think


[30-Aug-20 09:49 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
we used ingame chat at first


[30-Aug-20 09:49 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
then adopted discord around 2017ish


[30-Aug-20 09:50 PM] g r e g#4851
So the teammates that you have went to discord in 2017ish and then made this?


[30-Aug-20 09:50 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
no, teammates rotated over the years


[30-Aug-20 09:50 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
as I was the only one keeping the empire alive


[30-Aug-20 09:50 PM] g r e g#4851

[30-Aug-20 09:51 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I was fighting TJ


[30-Aug-20 09:51 PM] g r e g#4851
Mhm


[30-Aug-20 09:51 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

Oof


[30-Aug-20 09:51 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[30-Aug-20 09:51 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I relogged


[30-Aug-20 09:51 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and was banned for combatlogging


[30-Aug-20 09:51 PM] g r e g#4851
:-O


[30-Aug-20 09:52 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the irony is, the server had a sequel


[30-Aug-20 09:52 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I became staff on the sequel


[30-Aug-20 09:52 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
but that is a whole different war


[30-Aug-20 09:52 PM] g r e g#4851

me being a veitnam style rebel


[30-Aug-20 09:52 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
until the tribe of TJ collapsed


[30-Aug-20 09:52 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and I got gud gear


[30-Aug-20 09:52 PM] g r e g#4851

[30-Aug-20 09:53 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and then the server died right when I finally became staff


[30-Aug-20 09:53 PM] g r e g#4851
Like a vietcong guerilla


[30-Aug-20 09:53 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

Diamonds army (pirate cove)
I was thinking of having a new army called diamonds army on pvp servers, starting with pirate cove 2, and maybe even other servers.  We could start by making a military base on it.  P.s. Ever since tj left pirate cove has been lonely.

mods work differently


[30-Aug-20 10:02 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
they are serverside


[30-Aug-20 10:02 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
not clientside


[30-Aug-20 10:02 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so most servers have mods


[30-Aug-20 10:03 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
one of the things it does better then minecraft


[30-Aug-20 10:03 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
though, at the cost


[30-Aug-20 10:03 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
of mods not being able to do crazy things


[30-Aug-20 10:03 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
like minecraft mods can


[30-Aug-20 10:03 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
with miniblocks and such


[30-Aug-20 10:04 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[30-Aug-20 10:04 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and you find them and gear in chests


[30-Aug-20 10:04 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
that regen


[30-Aug-20 10:04 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
basically hunger games but in the sky


[30-Aug-20 10:05 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and the map never resets


[30-Aug-20 10:05 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and you respawn

[30-Aug-20 10:05 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
but basically


[30-Aug-20 10:05 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
there was a center spawn island with the worst loot


[30-Aug-20 10:05 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and islands around it with better gear


[30-Aug-20 10:05 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
there were 2 islands for each "loot table"


[30-Aug-20 10:05 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
mirroring eachother


[30-Aug-20 10:06 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and the armor peices were scattered in them


[30-Aug-20 10:06 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so what I did


[30-Aug-20 10:06 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
oh, and the Empire was now called The Diamond Empire then


[30-Aug-20 10:06 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
will find the old flag

[30-Aug-20 10:08 PM] superioroberto#8726
alexios


[30-Aug-20 10:09 PM] superioroberto#8726
did you draw that


[30-Aug-20 10:09 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
yeah


[30-Aug-20 10:09 PM] superioroberto#8726
i knew it


[30-Aug-20 10:09 PM] superioroberto#8726
haha


[30-Aug-20 10:09 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
lmao


[30-Aug-20 10:09 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
basically, I recruited some people on the server


[30-Aug-20 10:09 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and fought noobs to gain respect as a warrior


[30-Aug-20 10:10 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and I CONQUERED THE ENTIRE SERVER


[30-Aug-20 10:10 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
(it was a small af map but still)


[30-Aug-20 10:10 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
It was a semi-anarchy server


[30-Aug-20 10:10 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so I could rightfully say that


[30-Aug-20 10:10 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I made a throne of the leaf blocks (only block you could build with there)


[30-Aug-20 10:10 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and sat on it


[30-Aug-20 10:11 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and had a txt file of all the edicts and laws


[30-Aug-20 10:11 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and all my members


[30-Aug-20 10:11 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I even got to the point


[30-Aug-20 10:11 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
where I was able to BAN IRON ARMOR for all non soldiers


[30-Aug-20 10:11 PM] superioroberto#8726
holy shit


[30-Aug-20 10:11 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
(iron armor and swords was the best you could get on the server)


[30-Aug-20 10:11 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
yeah


[30-Aug-20 10:11 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I was able to enforce it


[30-Aug-20 10:12 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and I had f*cking bodygaurds and sh-t


[30-Aug-20 10:12 PM] superioroberto#8726
wow


[30-Aug-20 10:12 PM] superioroberto#8726
i actually didnt know that


[30-Aug-20 10:12 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
that was when the empire really took off


[30-Aug-20 10:12 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and became less of a Commando operation


[30-Aug-20 10:13 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I was a petty king of an entire flipping server


[30-Aug-20 10:13 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
with absolute rule


[30-Aug-20 10:13 PM] ùëá‚Ñéùëí ùê∑ùëñùëõùëòùë†ùë°ùëíùëü#7015
Damn


[30-Aug-20 10:13 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I even had a police force


[30-Aug-20 10:13 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb4EKqS2UKs


[30-Aug-20 10:13 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
again


[30-Aug-20 10:13 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
this is what the server looked like


[30-Aug-20 10:14 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
though


[30-Aug-20 10:14 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
rebellions began to form


[30-Aug-20 10:14 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and MTB and Turtle


[30-Aug-20 10:14 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
two irl brothers


[30-Aug-20 10:14 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
made an organized rebellion on the server


[30-Aug-20 10:15 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
they wanted to restore the days of anarchy


[30-Aug-20 10:15 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
before the Imperial ban on spawnkilling


[30-Aug-20 10:15 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
(spawnkilling was bad on that server as there was no spawn shield, on a roblox game sized map)


[30-Aug-20 10:17 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
This was my old theme back in those days

[30-Aug-20 10:18 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
made it on break period during school as I had chill teachers like that


[30-Aug-20 10:19 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
