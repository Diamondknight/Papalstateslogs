__**Elections & Reforms**__

Elections and Reforms are coming to the Papal States!

As you may have noticed, the channel layout has drastically changed. This will be followed up by the roles, when the massive militaristic, educational, and all around reforms are 100% complete. In addition, elections are coming up for the Patriarch of Rome, and the Secretary of State. On September 1st, the elections will open for the Patriarch of Rome to the Clergy. Only they can vote. Also on that day, the Secretary of State Elections will be open to everyone.

Thank you for your continued support throughout these changes.
**Glory to the State!**
**Glory to the Pope!**
**Glory to Roberto I!**
**Ave Maria!**

If you wish to volenteer for this chance to gain holdings and glory, react to this message with :Chirho:. Note you will have to get minetest, though it is a free opensource program so will not have to be bought. This uncharacteristically good minecraft clone is full of tribes that are cavemen compared to us, and due to it's opensource nature where it is developed by the community and forks are accepted, we could conquer THE ENTIRE GAME by flooding the volunteer dev team with our colonists.
