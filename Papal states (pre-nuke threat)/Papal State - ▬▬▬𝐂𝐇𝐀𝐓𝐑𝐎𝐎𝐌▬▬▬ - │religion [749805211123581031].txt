Psalm 97:2-7 - Revised Standard Version
<**2**> Clouds and thick darkness are round about him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. <**3**> Fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries round about. <**4**> His lightnings lighten the world; the earth sees and trembles. <**5**> The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth. <**6**> The heavens proclaim his righteousness; and all the peoples behold his glory. <**7**> All worshipers of images are put to shame, who make their boast in worthless idols; all gods bow down before him.
