I wouldn’t have this as a channel.


[31-Aug-20 11:41 AM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
It is brining shame to the sacrament. It is also wrong to have laymen attempt to recreate this.

> It is brining shame to the sacrament. It is also wrong to have laymen attempt to recreate this.

[31-Aug-20 12:06 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Should we have two sections for confessions


[31-Aug-20 12:06 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Like one that’s not serious and one that is


[31-Aug-20 12:08 PM] MiguelElRuso#7961
if you wanna confess seriously you do it to an actual priest doing the actual sacrament


[31-Aug-20 01:05 PM] Death over sin. (Pius)#9867
> if you wanna confess seriously you do it to an actual priest doing the actual sacrament
@MiguelElRuso  agreed. And there is no possible way it can be done online.


[31-Aug-20 01:05 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
True

[02-Sep-20 12:22 AM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Ask the pope


[02-Sep-20 12:23 AM] King Edward I#2029
What? Surely you as a cardinal, should know how a confession works, right?


[02-Sep-20 12:24 AM] King Edward I#2029
If we needed to get confessions from the pope only, Rome would be flooded.


[02-Sep-20 12:24 AM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Sadly I am not aquatinted with that knowledge as of yet


[02-Sep-20 12:24 AM] King Edward I#2029
...


[02-Sep-20 12:24 AM] King Edward I#2029
Firstly, there is no pope yet.


[02-Sep-20 12:25 AM] King Edward I#2029
Secondly, why would you take my confession if you never knew how to conduct one?


[02-Sep-20 12:25 AM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
:cri:


[02-Sep-20 12:25 AM] King Edward I#2029
Thirdly, and finally, why would the clergy not be prepared for this stuff?


[02-Sep-20 12:25 AM] King Edward I#2029

If I use the word of God ... it would be to evangelize, and sanctify my creator


[05-Sep-20 10:03 PM] King Edward I#2029
That is in vain, and not how you should talk about the creator


[05-Sep-20 10:04 PM] 𝕮 𝖔 𝖓 𝖘 𝖙 𝖆 𝖓 𝖙 𝖎 𝖓 𝖊#9507
If that is an expression in vain I do not want to imagine when they say OMG


[05-Sep-20 10:04 PM] King Edward I#2029
I am evangelizing the “clergy” so it is the closest thing to real life


[05-Sep-20 10:05 PM] King Edward I#2029
If you would like to help in any way, it would be appreciated


[05-Sep-20 10:06 PM] King Edward I#2029
Since you are a retired monk


[05-Sep-20 10:06 PM] 𝕮 𝖔 𝖓 𝖘 𝖙 𝖆 𝖓 𝖙 𝖎 𝖓 𝖊#9507

[05-Sep-20 10:11 PM] King Edward I#2029
We will have to use English as the standard


[05-Sep-20 10:11 PM] King Edward I#2029
Unless we allow another Martin Luther to do it for us because the people don’t understand Latin
