Technically now that I’m a cardinal I could run for pope


[30-Aug-20 11:52 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
But I’m already the leader of Switzerland and I don’t wanna turn into a boomer so nah

Salvete everyone. I have just been told a new election of pope is happening soon. I believe that I am the right candidate because many different reasons here are some. 1. I use to own a decently active and successful Papal States sever around when this was formed. I am very well acquainted with @Basileus Alexios VI Apokios as well and use to be the Catholic Patriarch of the Roman nation. I am very very well taught in theology and can settle matters of theology. I am a very experienced discord leader because I’ve had high positions within the Roman Empire. God bless. -Cardinal Pius

Bonum mane, everyone! Since the pontifical elections for leader of the Papacy is soon; I’d like to make clear why you should choose ME, Urban II, as the new head of the glorious holy nation.
1. I have been around in this server from a long time (did leave in between a few times). I also used to spent my time mostly here but I was later busy with irl stuff, so I couldn’t come on. But now I am more free, and am willing to return and become as active as possible and make the nation rise to its’ potential glory over the seven seas.
2. Sometimes I am a bit goofy depending on my mood, but when needed, I am CERTAINLY serious when needed to be.
3. I WILL certainly help to reconquer the Holy Lands. I will do my level best to help Byzantium as well as allies and vassal states.
4. The rest shall depend on God. Let us see what his decision shall be. I wish the candidates good luck. 🙏
Glory to the Papal States,
Glory to the Pope,
Glory to God in the highest,
Glory to Byzantium,
Ave Maria!

[01-Sep-20 11:59 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

[01-Sep-20 11:59 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
The channel for pope elections


[01-Sep-20 11:59 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And it was supposed to be between cardinals only


[02-Sep-20 12:00 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Can we have this election again but this time all cardinals will participate so everyone can have a fair chance


[02-Sep-20 12:00 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Not only the selected two


[02-Sep-20 12:00 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
We could also do a ceremony


[02-Sep-20 12:00 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
We did one of those when Pius was choosen


[02-Sep-20 12:01 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
It was a little bit cringy since there were few cardinals


[02-Sep-20 12:01 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
But this time we have an adequate amount of cardinals for the ceremony


[02-Sep-20 12:01 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
