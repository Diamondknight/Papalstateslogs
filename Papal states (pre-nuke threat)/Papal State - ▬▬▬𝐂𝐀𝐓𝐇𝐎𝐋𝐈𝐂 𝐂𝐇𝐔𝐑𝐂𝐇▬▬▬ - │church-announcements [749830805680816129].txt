So, my plans are simple, anyone who objects to these plans can de clergy themselves if they absolutely want to. I will start off with ***The Test***. Spooky I know, but it determines weather you clergy men know your business. If you pass the test, you can apply to become an export of the papacy, making churches in servers you are designated and preforming mass in said masses. Then, phase two of my plans goes as follows: the exported priests gain more power in both the Papal States and the host server. This is important in every server so that then, the relationship between the two servers is strengthened by religion. Phase three of my plan is simple, the people who didn’t do so well on. The religion test, but good on the moderation and diplomacy test, will become an Apostolic Nuncio. @—⛪The Clergy⛪—
