we have plans to revamp the clergy too


[30-Aug-20 08:47 PM] superioroberto#8726

Yes


[30-Aug-20 08:48 PM] superioroberto#8726
Anytime, man.


[30-Aug-20 08:48 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
instead of promotion via partnerships for clergy


[30-Aug-20 08:48 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Hmm


[30-Aug-20 08:48 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
How can I get a promotion


[30-Aug-20 08:48 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I have plans for promotion via actual clergy stuff


[30-Aug-20 08:48 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Oooooo


[30-Aug-20 08:48 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
like crusades and such


[30-Aug-20 08:48 PM] g r e g#4851
Will the rp aspect be still here or is it removed


[30-Aug-20 08:48 PM] superioroberto#8726
Of course.


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] superioroberto#8726
It's still here.


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] g r e g#4851
Noice


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015

Lol


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
:nice:


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I have plans to seperate the server into RP and non-RP sections


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] g r e g#4851
Think we shoukd


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so there is RP for when people want to RP


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] g r e g#4851
Should*


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] superioroberto#8726
#│shitposting Is a non rp channel, for example.


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and crusades for when people want to crusade


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
also, I am tossing around the idea for when we get bigger


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
to have a second server


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
"italian rebels"


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
to have RP wars


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Oof


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so the RP soldiers have something to do


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Don’t you mean atheists?


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
And heretics


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] superioroberto#8726
Oh, also, apart from the most active people, I will probably make everyone citizen.


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] superioroberto#8726
This is so that the clergy isn't inactive.


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Aight


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the RP is set in the early 1900s, so atheism is not that widespread yet


[30-Aug-20 08:50 PM] superioroberto#8726
If they wish to re-apply, they always can.


[30-Aug-20 08:55 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I AM GOING TO KILL SOMEONE


[30-Aug-20 08:55 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925

[30-Aug-20 08:55 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Do you want to know how?


[30-Aug-20 08:55 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015
Nah


[30-Aug-20 08:56 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
at last the imperial territories are connected in a sense


[30-Aug-20 08:56 PM] g r e g#4851
Sooooo we should just use this place for now right?


[30-Aug-20 08:56 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I am going to show you how I am going to kill someone


[30-Aug-20 08:56 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
remember when I conquered the revolt for the papacy?


[30-Aug-20 08:56 PM] g r e g#4851

[30-Aug-20 08:57 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
John wick, as you are a noble in the Empire I ennobled you here


[30-Aug-20 08:57 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Yes


[30-Aug-20 08:57 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
since you were an imperial vassal after the revolt was crushed


[30-Aug-20 08:58 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
but now since your old holdings are now re-united with the papal states


[30-Aug-20 08:58 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I was never willingly aligned with Pope Benedict


[30-Aug-20 08:58 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I was one of the people who thought to overthrow him

Oh, right.


[30-Aug-20 09:30 PM] g r e g#4851
Thank you


[30-Aug-20 09:30 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
You might be the last graduate of the old curiculum


[30-Aug-20 09:31 PM] g r e g#4851
I might be the last one lol


[30-Aug-20 09:31 PM] superioroberto#8726
We won't actually give you your education until the new curriculum is implemented.


[30-Aug-20 09:31 PM] g r e g#4851
Ok


[30-Aug-20 09:31 PM] superioroberto#8726
So we don't have to teach you twice or confuse you.


[30-Aug-20 09:31 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
yeah


[30-Aug-20 09:32 PM] g r e g#4851
Sooo no graduation until new Curriculum


[30-Aug-20 09:32 PM] MEE6#4876
Congratulations @g r e g, you just advanced to level 6. Ave Maria!


[30-Aug-20 09:32 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
new curriculum might take a bit though rob


[30-Aug-20 09:32 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so would probably have him do the old one


[30-Aug-20 09:35 PM] superioroberto#8726
Maybe.


[30-Aug-20 09:36 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
in the future might make imperial history a mandatory curriculum


[30-Aug-20 09:39 PM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015

We must start looking for a new Patriarch of Rome, or see if we will stay with the current pope


[30-Aug-20 11:09 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I say that we stay with the current pope


[30-Aug-20 11:09 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Wait


[30-Aug-20 11:09 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925

[30-Aug-20 11:13 PM] superioroberto#8726
when the time comes


[30-Aug-20 11:13 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
The papal election mechanics will be getting changed with the reforms


[30-Aug-20 11:13 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
they will be based more on piety and less on politics


[30-Aug-20 11:13 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the secular administrative roles like head of state and such will be for the politicians


[30-Aug-20 11:14 PM] superioroberto#8726
wdym politicans


[30-Aug-20 11:14 PM] superioroberto#8726
(i hate politicans)


[30-Aug-20 11:14 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the way it is rn


[30-Aug-20 11:14 PM] superioroberto#8726
ah


[30-Aug-20 11:14 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Yay!


[30-Aug-20 11:14 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I am a Bishop


[30-Aug-20 11:14 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
where the papacy is more of a political election


[30-Aug-20 11:14 PM] g r e g#4851
When can i do the test? Also are we using the old one or the new curriculum?


[30-Aug-20 11:14 PM] superioroberto#8726
btw myself and especially alexios' endorsements count alot


[30-Aug-20 11:15 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
old one so it does not keep people from taking it


[30-Aug-20 11:15 PM] g r e g#4851
Ok


[30-Aug-20 11:15 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
as new one is not done


[30-Aug-20 11:15 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I am Cardinal Bishop Lord John Wick


[30-Aug-20 11:15 PM] superioroberto#8726
i endorse john wick


[30-Aug-20 11:15 PM] superioroberto#8726
for patriarch of rome


[30-Aug-20 11:15 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Thank you


[30-Aug-20 11:15 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Your service will be rewarded


[30-Aug-20 11:16 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I have a better idea actually


[30-Aug-20 11:16 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Yes?


[30-Aug-20 11:17 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
He was almost successful in revolting against us, he would do well to go into the military and conquer his own providence


[30-Aug-20 11:17 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
after all


[30-Aug-20 11:17 PM] superioroberto#8726
perhaps


[30-Aug-20 11:17 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the enemy servers will not have a Roman Empire to save them


[30-Aug-20 11:17 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
unlike this one


[30-Aug-20 11:17 PM] superioroberto#8726
hm, yeah then we should make john wick head of the army


[30-Aug-20 11:17 PM] superioroberto#8726
he is probably our most capable general anyway


[30-Aug-20 11:18 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
Thank you


[30-Aug-20 11:18 PM] superioroberto#8726
ill make a role for general of the army


[30-Aug-20 11:18 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
So a Bishop and the head of the army?


[30-Aug-20 11:18 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
Yeah, he could become head of the regional armies


[30-Aug-20 11:18 PM] superioroberto#8726
hm


[30-Aug-20 11:18 PM] superioroberto#8726
should we allow bishops to have army positions?


[30-Aug-20 11:18 PM] superioroberto#8726
coming from a realistic sense


[30-Aug-20 11:18 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I will be guided by the power of God


[30-Aug-20 11:19 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I mean realistically, Papal Generals have been bishops and other religious leaders


[30-Aug-20 11:19 PM] superioroberto#8726
ah


[30-Aug-20 11:19 PM] Keanu Reeves#3925
I mean the Pope himself was a general of the army at one point in papal history


[30-Aug-20 11:19 PM] superioroberto#8726
very well then


[30-Aug-20 11:19 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
The bishop roles will be reworked though


[30-Aug-20 11:19 PM] superioroberto#8726
i guess its only fair


[30-Aug-20 11:19 PM] superioroberto#8726
well yeah, the clergy will be reworked


[30-Aug-20 11:19 PM] superioroberto#8726

[31-Aug-20 01:20 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
having kind of "raids" (not the bannable spam kind, but ones between two agreeing servers)


[31-Aug-20 01:20 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
where the enemy server's soldiers will go in


[31-Aug-20 01:20 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and use fight commands


[31-Aug-20 01:20 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
to fight a battle


[31-Aug-20 01:21 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so the soldiers can actually fight in RP


[31-Aug-20 01:21 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

[31-Aug-20 01:25 AM] superioroberto#8726
basically, benedict stepped down and allowed me to take ownership of the server


[31-Aug-20 01:25 AM] superioroberto#8726

[31-Aug-20 01:26 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925

Yeah


[31-Aug-20 01:26 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the server is also an autonomous part of the Empire now too


[31-Aug-20 01:26 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
infact, the capital of Catholicism in the Empire


[31-Aug-20 01:27 AM] Keanu Reeves#3925

yeah, but I plan on having clergy of every non-heretical sect each having their own "capital" server


[31-Aug-20 01:31 AM] Francinee#3469
It would have been interesting to see Orthodox clergy interaction as well


[31-Aug-20 01:31 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[31-Aug-20 01:31 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
is basically


[31-Aug-20 01:31 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
stuff like mormonism


[31-Aug-20 01:32 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[31-Aug-20 01:32 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

Welcome to the interactive paginator!

This interactively allows you to see pages of text by navigating with messages. They are as follows:

`n, next, next page` goes to the next page
`b, back, previous` goes to the previous page
`s, stop, e, end` stops the interactive pagination session
`f, first, first page` goes to the first page
`l, last, last page` goes to the last page
`h, help` shows this message
`p, page` lets you type a page number to go to

Make sure the bot has `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission to prevent chat log spam.
You can also manually add the emojis to control the paginator; if it's out of chat view.

Emojis include: 

◀ goes to the previous page
▶ goes to the next page
⏹ stops the interactive pagination session
🔢 lets you type a page number to go to
We were on page 1 before this message.

Salvete everyone. I have just been told a new election of pope is happening soon. I believe that I am the right candidate because many different reasons here are some. 1. I use to own a decently active and successful Papal States sever around when this was formed. I am very well acquainted with @Basileus Alexios VI Apokios as well and use to be the Catholic Patriarch of the Roman nation. I am very very well taught in theology and can settle matters of theology. I am a very experienced discord leader because I’ve had high positions within the Roman Empire. I also be wayyyyyyy more active then currently. God bless. -Cardinal Pius

I copied a map and put a basic "You are here"(though I didn't put those exact words) that you normally see in Malls or something.

We are most known for supplying most of the States and the World with most agricultural products. Corn, Wheat, Beans(Mainly Soybeans), Pork and the like.

I'm not sure it'll go back to normal, but I hope we do(as do many of my fellow Americans).

Trump is actually doing what is needed to be done, but he's going by the Constitution. He might be the most recent President to not treat the Constitution like a Cum-rag.

[01-Sep-20 03:08 AM] Bennie Thomas#1632
Guys


[01-Sep-20 03:08 AM] Bennie Thomas#1632
What country


[01-Sep-20 03:08 AM] Bennie Thomas#1632
should I


[01-Sep-20 03:08 AM] Bennie Thomas#1632
do


[01-Sep-20 03:08 AM] Foliamane#3308
We have given you multiple countries to choose from


[01-Sep-20 03:09 AM] Foliamane#3308
Yet you ask for more


[01-Sep-20 03:16 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
depends on what "playstyle"


[01-Sep-20 03:16 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
eg. prussia would be more military based


[01-Sep-20 03:17 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
as the Roman Empire would be more religion based


[01-Sep-20 03:17 AM] Foliamane#3308
What are you talking about


[01-Sep-20 03:17 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
what kind of culture he wants basically


[01-Sep-20 03:17 AM] Foliamane#3308
Ahhh


[01-Sep-20 03:18 AM] Foliamane#3308
But still we have mentioned multiple countries to choose from yet he doesn't want them


[01-Sep-20 03:18 AM] Foliamane#3308
But there aren't any other countries that already exist


[01-Sep-20 03:19 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
he can do one that already exists if it is not on good terms with us


[01-Sep-20 03:19 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
he can fight for the title


[01-Sep-20 03:19 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
eg. "I AM THE REAL PRUSSIA"


[01-Sep-20 03:19 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
*proceeds to ally swarm him*


[01-Sep-20 03:20 AM] Foliamane#3308
He can, but he doesn't


[01-Sep-20 03:28 AM] Bennie Thomas#1632
> he can do one that already exists if it is not on good terms with us
@Basileus Alexios VI Apokios  like what exactly


[01-Sep-20 03:28 AM] Bennie Thomas#1632
give me specific examples


[01-Sep-20 03:28 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
basically what I mean


[01-Sep-20 03:28 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
is I am not going to encourage him to attack our allies


[01-Sep-20 03:28 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
over a title


[01-Sep-20 03:28 AM] Bennie Thomas#1632
hm


[01-Sep-20 03:28 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
but if they are not our allies or otherwise friendly


[01-Sep-20 03:29 AM] Bennie Thomas#1632
do u even have any allies yet other than the papacy


[01-Sep-20 03:29 AM] Bennie Thomas#1632
@Basileus Alexios VI Apokios


[01-Sep-20 03:31 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the papacy is no longer an ally but one with the Empire


[01-Sep-20 03:31 AM] MEE6#4876
Congratulations @Basileus Alexios VI Apokios, you just advanced to level 15. Ave Maria!


[01-Sep-20 03:31 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
we unified somewhat


[01-Sep-20 03:32 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
but still keeping local customs alive, because I know what happens when I do not

[01-Sep-20 03:33 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Our recognised lands ^


[01-Sep-20 03:33 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Did we get more from the unification


[01-Sep-20 03:34 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Above us are the swiss


[01-Sep-20 03:34 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
The hre


[01-Sep-20 03:34 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
we do not really have RP lands as we are not an RP nation-server pretty much as you could tell by the very real crusades against that anti-christian guy


[01-Sep-20 03:35 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
The empire


[01-Sep-20 03:35 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Right


[01-Sep-20 03:35 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
yeah


[01-Sep-20 03:35 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the empire


[01-Sep-20 03:35 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Mhm


[01-Sep-20 03:35 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
So we technically didn't gained any land


[01-Sep-20 03:35 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
But that's okay


[01-Sep-20 03:35 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
We have majority of italy


[01-Sep-20 03:36 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And I got epirus as a reward for participating in the Portuguese - Brazilian war


[01-Sep-20 03:36 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
when the final reforms are done and the big remodel happens will probably use the fighting commands to have RP wars where other gov sims we are in an RP war against can try to attack and our soldiers will defend


[01-Sep-20 03:36 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And technically Brazil and Portugal united


[01-Sep-20 03:36 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Forming the Lusitanian union


[01-Sep-20 03:36 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and if a soldier looses a "duel" they will be "dead" for that battle


[01-Sep-20 03:36 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Mhm


[01-Sep-20 03:36 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and have to wait until next one to participate again


[01-Sep-20 03:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Can we use that dank memer


[01-Sep-20 03:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Bot


[01-Sep-20 03:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
For it


[01-Sep-20 03:37 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
yeah, until a better bot is found for fighting


[01-Sep-20 03:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
It has the pls fight command


[01-Sep-20 03:37 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
yeah


[01-Sep-20 03:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Yes


[01-Sep-20 03:37 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
that was the command I was thinking about using for it


[01-Sep-20 03:38 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and having a new server made when we get big enough


[01-Sep-20 03:38 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
called "italian rebels"


[01-Sep-20 03:38 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
that will be the enemies when we are not in an RP war


[01-Sep-20 03:38 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so the soldiers do not get bored and have a reason to stay active


[01-Sep-20 03:41 AM] Rick Astley#4016

This shows the ruthless advance of the artificial culture created by the "progressives"


[01-Sep-20 08:11 AM] KAndrewMahn#0619
Wait, seeing that there are clothes in the shop, are we all just in a state of undress before we buy it?

It was already spreading fast before the edict of milan


[01-Sep-20 09:37 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
also, depends on whether the Greeks ever get Constantinople back or not


[01-Sep-20 09:40 AM] 𝕮 𝖔 𝖓 𝖘 𝖙 𝖆 𝖓 𝖙 𝖎 𝖓 𝖊#9507
Likewise and unfortunately the Greeks at this time had nothing to do with it ... But I believe that Christianity began to spread 1 or 2 years later after the Death of Christ, I say because already in Armenia the first kingdom was already declared Christian en masse.

Infantry troops were partially conscripted, partially voluntary. Egyptian soldiers worked for pay, both natives and mercenaries. Of mercenary troops, Nubians were used beginning in the late Old Kingdom, Asiatic maryannu troops were used in the Middle and New Kingdoms, the Sherden, Libyans, and the "Na'arn" were used in the Ramesside Period, and Phoenicians, Carians, and Greeks were used during the Late Period.

egyptian mythology


[01-Sep-20 12:22 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
bruh


[01-Sep-20 12:23 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
it is older than greek


[01-Sep-20 12:23 PM] MiguelElRuso#7961
in greek mithology I remember a lot of demigods


[01-Sep-20 12:23 PM] MiguelElRuso#7961
maybe I do my memory is quite shitty


[01-Sep-20 12:23 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
ancient egyption religion is one of the first religions ever


[01-Sep-20 12:23 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
its amazing


[01-Sep-20 12:24 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
Animism is the first religion but it isnt structured


[01-Sep-20 12:24 PM] MiguelElRuso#7961
I see


[01-Sep-20 12:25 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
Totemism and Fetishists are more structured but ancient egypt really made a very good religion


[01-Sep-20 12:25 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
so i consider it the first religion in the world


[01-Sep-20 12:25 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
but others may say animism is the first and they wouldnt be wrong


[01-Sep-20 12:25 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
I studied this in class


[01-Sep-20 12:25 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
I actually studied this while math class XDD


[01-Sep-20 12:25 PM] Tolgus (depression hit me again)#5940
I studied this in EU4


[01-Sep-20 12:26 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
dude everything is more interesting than math


[01-Sep-20 12:26 PM] Tolgus (depression hit me again)#5940

[01-Sep-20 12:26 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
for me


[01-Sep-20 12:26 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
atleast


[01-Sep-20 12:26 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
after the AER, comes the greek mythology


[01-Sep-20 12:27 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
and then comes taoism, but it isnt wide spread and back then people didnt write where it started in north india


[01-Sep-20 12:27 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
hinduism ideas come from taoism to make their religion because their tribes could write


[01-Sep-20 12:27 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
facts


[01-Sep-20 12:27 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
which many people dont know


[01-Sep-20 12:28 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
because they cant prove it


[01-Sep-20 12:28 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250
anyway, people also call hinduism the first religion because it survived to this day


[01-Sep-20 12:28 PM] Gabriela_Nazirin#7250

[02-Sep-20 02:32 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I started missing


[02-Sep-20 02:32 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
My server


[02-Sep-20 02:32 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And decided to fill in some stuff


[02-Sep-20 02:32 AM] superioroberto#8726
my point here is, i don’t want you to tire yourself, endlessly chasing these admin powers because you can’t let go


[02-Sep-20 02:32 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And just supervise


[02-Sep-20 02:32 AM] superioroberto#8726

The Soviet Union not only believes but knows that this Romanian Empire thing is out of control. What they are doing is in violation of the EU. Our plans for this war against the Romanian Empire is to take control and occupy them like what we did in 1944-1958. (1/2)

I think why people have mixed views


[03-Sep-20 01:03 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
On me


[03-Sep-20 01:03 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Cuz I was too nice with everyone and some people probably didn't like that


[03-Sep-20 01:03 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Or my views


[03-Sep-20 01:03 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Were too liberal


[03-Sep-20 01:03 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Or different


[03-Sep-20 01:04 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Or I was a bit weak and had trust issues

__**Cancelling freedom of speech**__

• I propose that anyone who insults, disrespect:- The Pope , ☧ Patriarch of Rome ☧ ☩Basileus of the Romans☩ , ☩The Server Owner☩ , ☩Father of the Nation☩ to be punished as one should always respect their leaders as a citizen and it would be treason to go against them. 

•The Pope/Patriarch of Rome should be spoken to like 'Your Holiness'

•The basileus, the server owner and the father of the nation should be spoken to like 'Your Honour' 

• cardinals shall receive a title 'monsieur' and people below the rank of cardinal bishop has to call them monsieur

@Pope Benedict XV how do you think you can demote me? That’s a imperial position not a papal one. You don’t have power within the empire. I am a subject of the empire. So you do not have the right to demote me.

[06-Sep-20 12:35 AM] Chill Vibes™#9652
Did you setup permit levels yet?


[06-Sep-20 12:35 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
the previous guy who came for support said that it is overlapping or smth


[06-Sep-20 12:36 AM] Chill Vibes™#9652
And another reason for mutes not working is due to incorrect setup


[06-Sep-20 12:36 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
hm


[06-Sep-20 12:36 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

An incorrect setup is more than likely when the mute command does not work.


[06-Sep-20 12:46 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
hm?


[06-Sep-20 12:46 AM] Foliamane#3308

[06-Sep-20 12:48 AM] Chill Vibes™#9652

[06-Sep-20 12:49 AM] Chill Vibes™#9652

[06-Sep-20 12:49 AM] Chill Vibes™#9652

To all the people currently online and willing to listen, recently, I have lost my girlfriend and my dog to the grim reaper, over the last couple of days, I have taken some time off discord to regather myself mentally. I will now aim to be as active as possible and listen to what you all have to say.

[07-Sep-20 05:59 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
was doing playtesting for a modpack I might release


[07-Sep-20 05:59 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
a tornado spawned not even my first night in


[07-Sep-20 06:00 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
with the rlcraft health system mod and a limited lives mod


[07-Sep-20 06:00 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
ran for shelter because my modpack starts you in a village


[07-Sep-20 06:01 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
(was on the outskirts cutting down trees)


[07-Sep-20 06:01 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
as I was running into the village I got picked up and flung ontop of a village house


[07-Sep-20 06:02 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
was shifting to hold on tight to the fence on the top of it (1.12 village gen)


[07-Sep-20 06:02 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I decided to jump to try to get into the house


[07-Sep-20 06:02 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and it flung me straight into the eye of the tornado


[07-Sep-20 06:03 PM] Pǔyí#5782
Oh


[07-Sep-20 06:04 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
being one for practical RP to increase immersion, I "panicked" and let go of my primitive axe and it fell into the pond I think


[07-Sep-20 06:04 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
I was flung back to the ground


[07-Sep-20 06:04 PM] Pǔyí#5782
Oh


[07-Sep-20 06:04 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and I got in the water


[07-Sep-20 06:04 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[07-Sep-20 06:04 PM] Pǔyí#5782

Annonce it and give them some time to amass


[07-Sep-20 06:05 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
note that the Imperial coronation process for me will be ad-libbing due to not having the propper procedure codified into Imperial law


[07-Sep-20 06:05 PM] Pǔyí#5782
Oh


[07-Sep-20 06:06 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
not adlibbing as in total sh*t


[07-Sep-20 06:06 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[07-Sep-20 06:06 PM] King Edward I#2029

[07-Sep-20 06:06 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
just not as magestic and glorious as what is planned to be codifed

But if that's too confusing


[07-Sep-20 06:53 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
the only reason I have a special role is this server is part of the Empire

Getting mixed up with you and stuff


[07-Sep-20 06:53 PM] Pǔyí#5782

[07-Sep-20 06:54 PM] Pǔyí#5782
What does Constantine own


[07-Sep-20 06:55 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
Constantine is the Pope basically


[07-Sep-20 06:55 PM] Pǔyí#5782
Oh wow


[07-Sep-20 06:55 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
but non-RP


[07-Sep-20 06:55 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
in the sense


[07-Sep-20 06:55 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
that less RP politics


[07-Sep-20 06:55 PM] Pǔyí#5782
That he is educated


[07-Sep-20 06:55 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and more missionary work


[07-Sep-20 06:55 PM] Pǔyí#5782
My idea was this


[07-Sep-20 06:56 PM] Pǔyí#5782
†Holy Roman Emperor†


[07-Sep-20 06:56 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
As I said


[07-Sep-20 06:56 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
every protectorate Emperor


[07-Sep-20 06:56 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
cannot have a unique cosmetic role


[07-Sep-20 06:56 PM] Pǔyí#5782
Oh


[07-Sep-20 06:56 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
though, with reforms


[07-Sep-20 06:56 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
will be having government rank specific roles


[07-Sep-20 06:57 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and governments ranked by power as opposed to RP titles


[07-Sep-20 06:57 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
eg. a duchy server with 1000 members would be recognized way higher


[07-Sep-20 06:57 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
in ruler rank


[07-Sep-20 06:57 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
then an Emperor with 15 members


[07-Sep-20 06:58 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
The old government rank system:

[07-Sep-20 07:00 PM] Pǔyí#5782
I see


[07-Sep-20 07:00 PM] Pǔyí#5782
But I find it rather odd that I was crowned in THIS server by the Pope himself


[07-Sep-20 07:01 PM] Pǔyí#5782
Yet my authority isn't recognised


[07-Sep-20 07:01 PM] Pǔyí#5782
I guess I'll have to develop my server more


[07-Sep-20 07:01 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
Mainly because handing over half my power would not be up to the Pope


[07-Sep-20 07:02 PM] Pǔyí#5782

Broken footsteps on the floor,
Pick myself up and carry on, cause something's waiting for me,
And I will let them write my song,
Keep my direction and soon I'll﻿ be turned to gold.
I'm a king without a throne, a heart without a home,
Just cards that I've been dealt in life.
I walk the road alone, but my hope will never die

"The Anniversary of the September 11th Attacks

The anniversary of the crimes committed against man by Al-Qaeda

The September 11th attacks were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda against the United States on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The attacks resulted in 2,977 fatalities, over 25,000 injuries, and substantial long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage. It was the single deadliest terrorist attack in human history and the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States, with 343 and 72 killed, respectively.

Today is the 19th anniversary since that day, and we stand in solidarity with the families and friends of the victims, as well as the victims themselves in this hard time. We as a species must take heed to this event and take action we can so that  something like it never happens again, for no matter what coat of paint you lay upon it, it was not just an attack on America, it was an attack on innocent human lives."

@superioroberto Just admit that you failed it's honorable to admit your failures. But *don't* try to blame me for a revolution, all I do is to speak out what everybody thinks.
We need the old constitution and perhaps our old leader.
