The Anniversary of the September 11th Attacks

The anniversary of the crimes committed against man by Al-Qaeda

The September 11th attacks were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda against the United States on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The attacks resulted in 2,977 fatalities, over 25,000 injuries, and substantial long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage. It was the single deadliest terrorist attack in human history and the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States, with 343 and 72 killed, respectively.

Today is the 19th anniversary since that day, and we stand in solidarity with the families and friends of the victims, as well as the victims themselves in this hard time. We as a species must take heed to this event and take action we can so that  something like it never happens again, for no matter what coat of paint you lay upon it, it was not just an attack on America, it was an attack on innocent human lives.
