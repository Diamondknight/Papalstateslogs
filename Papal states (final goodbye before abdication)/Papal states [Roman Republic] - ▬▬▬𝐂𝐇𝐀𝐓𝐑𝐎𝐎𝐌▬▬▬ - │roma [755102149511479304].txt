Yes


[14-Sep-20 02:16 PM] FJ#1191
@Basileus Alexios VI Apokios 
The only thing I did was to say that I wanted the old pope back, so i'm not going to participate in the trial


[14-Sep-20 02:17 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
@Basileus Alexios VI Apokios I can fix the old server

[14-Sep-20 02:21 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

do you trust me?


[14-Sep-20 02:22 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
yes, but I also trusted poggersboggers before he nuked the server


[14-Sep-20 02:22 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
mattia's agents are possibly everywhere


[14-Sep-20 02:23 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
I was in the server before the whole Mattia thing

[14-Sep-20 02:33 PM] Rick Astley#4016
Ok


[14-Sep-20 02:33 PM] Rick Astley#4016
Let's reform this


[14-Sep-20 02:33 PM] Alk Fouq#5552
Btw, idk why but I made a copy of the "#respect" channel, here it is

When speaking to High Ranks (Minister and above in politics, top 4 ranks below Generals and Admirals in military):
Instead of "Yes", say "ita"
Instead of "No", say "Nihil"
Instead of "Yes Sir!", say "ita Domine!"
Instead of "Sir", say "Domine"
Respect everyone regardless of their ranks.
When you see @Unknown @Unknown typing in chat:
Say "Glory to the state, Glory to the pope, ave Maria"
Don't argue with the pope you can only give him advise and suggestions.
When you talk to members of the college of cardinals you have to call them as 'monsigneur'


[14-Sep-20 02:33 PM] superioroberto#8726
not gonna add that back


[14-Sep-20 02:33 PM] superioroberto#8726
no one listens to that and it’s pretty useless


[14-Sep-20 02:34 PM] Rick Astley#4016
I was a former cardinal


[14-Sep-20 02:34 PM] FJ#1191
Me too


[14-Sep-20 02:34 PM] Rick Astley#4016
but I got banned I think


[14-Sep-20 02:34 PM] Alk Fouq#5552
Almost everyone got banned from the server


[14-Sep-20 02:35 PM] superioroberto#8726
alr im gonna add bots and ill give you guys roles


[14-Sep-20 02:35 PM] superioroberto#8726
Most likely won’t be permanent tho

I mean the user


[14-Sep-20 02:42 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
maybe that is why he used an unorthodox nuke


[14-Sep-20 02:42 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[14-Sep-20 02:43 PM] Foliamane#3308
If you had some way of having the audit logs this could have been way easier


[14-Sep-20 02:44 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
hold up, can check


[14-Sep-20 02:44 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
they did not ban me or rob


[14-Sep-20 02:44 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
I can delete the webhook


[14-Sep-20 02:44 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
and rebuild the server


[14-Sep-20 02:44 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
as they could only ban up to their bot's role in heiarchy


[14-Sep-20 02:45 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661
so you can keep it as a "monument"


[14-Sep-20 02:45 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
no, the server is BEYOND repair


[14-Sep-20 02:45 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
no, already have logs of it


[14-Sep-20 02:45 PM] Canuelas Mapper#6661

the only person we should be confessing our sins to is Jesus himself


[14-Sep-20 08:50 PM] CubBlitz#5071
Jesus dying on the cross meant that he tore the veil between man and god

he bridged the gap

Can you vote me as the new pope in #announcements? I will make the Papal States great again as it once was. Please vote for me. I will use the best methods to make the server good as it once used to be, and improve the power and the people. I will also increase activity, and make the server fun. I will also increase some more rights for women’s employment in the server. Ave Roma. 🇻🇦

papal states old server was nuked


[15-Sep-20 09:22 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
edward then declared war


[15-Sep-20 09:22 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
then he started showing everyone propaganda


[15-Sep-20 09:23 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

[15-Sep-20 09:23 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
then he started getting some citizens against me


[15-Sep-20 09:23 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
idk they keep changing their discord name


[15-Sep-20 09:23 AM] Fabian#7797
could you fetch their ID?


[15-Sep-20 09:23 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
they used a webhook to spam the channels without getting easily found


[15-Sep-20 09:23 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
but eventually found them


[15-Sep-20 09:23 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
and banned them


[15-Sep-20 09:24 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
but since I deleted all the spammed futa porn he posted, idk his ID


[15-Sep-20 09:24 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
99% of the nuke/raid on us was by webhooks


[15-Sep-20 09:29 AM] 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟#7015

[15-Sep-20 09:31 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

where the owner is not even trying to have state leaders


[15-Sep-20 09:36 AM] Geraff#0001

[15-Sep-20 12:04 PM] Francinee#3469
I’m considering forming my own political party.


[15-Sep-20 12:04 PM] Ice water#1632
Benedict founded this place. He took care of it like his own child.


[15-Sep-20 12:04 PM] Ice water#1632
Etc.


[15-Sep-20 12:04 PM] Rick Astley#4016
But benidict probably added xenon


[15-Sep-20 12:05 PM] Francinee#3469
The Byzantine integration was not fully embraced, thus it could not work.


[15-Sep-20 12:05 PM] Pǔyí#5782

A Greek Orthodox homosexual Byzantine Emperor and violent usurper was teaching a class on Alexios Apokios, known debt evader.


[15-Sep-20 12:10 PM] Pǔyí#5782
"Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Alexios Apokios and accept that he was the most majestic Roman Emperor the world has ever known, even greater than Constantine the Great!"


[15-Sep-20 12:10 PM] Pǔyí#5782
At this moment a brave, patriotic, pro-Catholic Templar Banker-Knight who had bankrupted over 1500 Muslims on a Crusade and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all economic decisions made by the Pope stood up and held up a fresh Septuagint.


[15-Sep-20 12:10 PM] Rick Astley#4016

[15-Sep-20 12:10 PM] Pǔyí#5782
"Who compiled this Bible, caesaropapist?"


[15-Sep-20 12:10 PM] Pǔyí#5782
The treacherous Emperor smirked quite Turkicly and smugly replied "The Roman scribes, you stupid barbarian.


[15-Sep-20 12:10 PM] Pǔyí#5782
"Wrong. It's been 1,000 years since the Roman Empire fell. If it is 1,400 years old and Greece, as you say, is the home of the Romans, then why don't you possess the Eternal City of Rome itself?"

[15-Sep-20 12:11 PM] Pǔyí#5782
The Emperor was visibly shaken, and dropped his gaudy icon and copy of Plutarch's Parallel Lives. He stormed out of the room crying those Greek crocodile tears. The same tears Greeks cry for the "disgraced Romans" when they jealously try to claw justly earned land from the deserving Crusaders. There is no doubt that at this point our Emperor, Basileus Palaiologos, wished he had more strictly enforced the East-West Union as agreed upon at the Council of Florence. He wished so much that he had the Imperial Sword to kill himself from embarrassment, but he himself had pawned it off to the Romans!


[15-Sep-20 12:11 PM] Pǔyí#5782
The students applauded and all joined the Holy Roman Empire that day and accepted Pope Eugene IV as Christ's Vicar on Earth. A double-headed eagle named "Serenissima" flew into the room and shed a tear on the chalk. Dies Irae was sung several times, and the Doge himself showed up and enacted a liquidation of debtors' assets across the country to renovate St. Peter's Basilica


[15-Sep-20 12:11 PM] Francinee#3469

[15-Sep-20 12:11 PM] Pǔyí#5782
The Emperor lost Constantinople and died of the Black Debt the next day.


[15-Sep-20 12:11 PM] Francinee#3469
@Rick Astley what are you doing?


[15-Sep-20 12:12 PM] Ice water#1632

[15-Sep-20 12:12 PM] Ice water#1632
@Rick Astley Okay but like seriously


[15-Sep-20 12:12 PM] Francinee#3469
You cannot simply denounce Alexios’ reforms.


[15-Sep-20 12:12 PM] Ice water#1632
You can’t rename the League of Constantinople


[15-Sep-20 12:12 PM] Ice water#1632

[15-Sep-20 12:12 PM] Francinee#3469
This would put us at dispute.


[15-Sep-20 12:12 PM] Rick Astley#4016
well ok


[15-Sep-20 12:12 PM] Ice water#1632
That’s more of Byzantine alliance.
