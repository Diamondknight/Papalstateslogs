Make the server pope benidict times,however pope benidict should not retain ownership,more like co-owner,cancel the Byzantine reforms


[15-Sep-20 12:58 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212

The situation here has become impossible


[15-Sep-20 01:26 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
there are more enemy spies then actual citizens


[15-Sep-20 01:26 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
This is a fruitless endevor


[15-Sep-20 01:27 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
The server ownership is passing to @CubBlitz soon, and will be part of his republic


[15-Sep-20 01:27 PM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
so that this server will not go to edward
