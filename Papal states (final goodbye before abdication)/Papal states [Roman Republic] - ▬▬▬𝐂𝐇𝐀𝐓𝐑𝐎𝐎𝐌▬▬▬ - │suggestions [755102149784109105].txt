I am not saying that Alexios is a bad administrator, I am saying that it was easier, just to reorder the server with the Vatican structure, than to do a reform that wastes time and energy to transform your holy city into something Byzantine that had nothing to do with it.


[15-Sep-20 10:11 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
We have to reform


[15-Sep-20 10:12 AM] Basileus Alexios VI Apokios#6212
look at the chaos here the second everyone sees we were weakened by a nuke


[15-Sep-20 10:14 AM] 𝕮 𝖔 𝖓 𝖘 𝖙 𝖆 𝖓 𝖙 𝖎 𝖓 𝖊#9507
HAHAHAJ ... I think the structure that Benedict had was better ... since you made the reform, we lost colonies, we did not control our army, and everything collapsed and the reduction of more than 180 members

it was not the reform

it was edward/space and geraff deciding they want to conquer us


[15-Sep-20 10:17 AM] 𝕮 𝖔 𝖓 𝖘 𝖙 𝖆 𝖓 𝖙 𝖎 𝖓 𝖊#9507
Every present has a past, alexios ...


If you had not done the Byzantine reform, the server would still be active, and everything in order, only this happened because we believed the lie that Benedict was a communist ... and we are all infatuated

@Basileus Alexios VI Apokios

```A piece of advice.```

__**TO: Alexios VI Apokios, Basileus of the Romans, Constantinople, Byzantine Empire.**__

Hello there. So I have a few pieces of advice you, and the staff could all work on. (Some of these are actually publicly supported)
```
• Bring slightly more democracy into the state’s system, as authoritarianism wouldn’t really improve much.
• Bring back Papa Benedict XV’s old structure. Since these reforms, we have lost many colonies, territories, and the server has reduced into a weak rump state of the former Papacy. We have also lost alot of our manpower, and our army. Had you not done so many reforms and power changes, this server would have stayed alive, and everything in order and peace. (suggested by the public too, also I’m not calling you a “tyrant” as you thought I was earlier.)
• Return Pope Benedict XV his ownership. (Benedict also wants his ownership back + majority of the state wants him to get his ownership back.)
• Halt the Byzantine reforms of the Papacy, this is something I deeply suggest.
• If there is anything to be added, I will edit here later.```

Farewell. Please do read this and consider, @Basileus Alexios VI Apokios.

@👨‍👩‍👧‍👦Papal Citizens👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Dear brothers, I mentioned you just to announce this:


From now on I will be supporting Benedict so that the old and better structure returns, I prefer what Benedict does. I will no longer support this reform ...

This will not end well for any of them, surely Alexios knows it but ignores it, his reform, it took a lot of time and effort in vain, I think in it
last month, our statistical numbers since the reform were going down and negatively

Lost colonies
Loss of prestige and control over our army and many other things ... I do not want to accept the position of Patriarch of Rome without seeing our nation flourishing


LET'S MAKE THE VATICAN GREAT AGAIN!

He is the father of the nation, to compare him to his successors is not very viable.

his successors merely passed on an already developing server, it is up to them to send it to ruin or to glory.

Benedict is the one who kept the server for too long, and made it perfect ... instead, the Byzantine Reformation happened on a revolutionary whim

```A piece of word.```

__**TO: all.**__

Hello there. So I have a few pieces of advice you, and the staff could all work on. (Some of these are actually publicly supported)
```
• Bring slightly more democracy into the state’s system, as authoritarianism wouldn’t really improve much.
• Bring back Papa Benedict XV’s old structure. Since these reforms, we have lost many colonies, territories, and the server has reduced into a weak rump state of the former Papacy. We have also lost alot of our manpower, and our army. Had you not done so many reforms and power changes, this server would have stayed alive, and everything in order and peace. (suggested by the public too, also I’m not calling you a “tyrant” as you thought I was earlier.)
• Return Pope Benedict XV his ownership. (Benedict also wants his ownership back + majority of the state wants him to get his ownership back.)
• Halt the Byzantine reforms of the Papacy, this is something I deeply suggest.
• If there is anything to be added, I will edit here later.```

Farewell. Please do read this,
