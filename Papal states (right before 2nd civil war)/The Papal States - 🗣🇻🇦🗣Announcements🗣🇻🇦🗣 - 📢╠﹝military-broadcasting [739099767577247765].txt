[04-Aug-20 01:19 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Greetings dear Citizens! It is time to reveal what happened and what we were involved in the past few days, now that we are safe and the war is over and I can finnaly tell you what happened. Yes, so basically we were in a war to protect our ally @ùëá‚Ñéùëí ùê∑ùëñùëõùëòùë†ùë°ùëíùëü (Switzerland) the war was against a neo Nazi server. This war could have gone really bad for us as the enemy and it's ally had nukes. As soon as we found out me and my allies who were in support of Switzerland(btw they didn't know that the swiss had allies lol) planned to go on a defensive and gather info from the enemy server by infiltrating them (which I personally did) so after few days the enemy called upon its ally but something bad happened and their ally back stabbed them. After that I disguised myself and made contact with enemy leaders and took info from them. Due to the main enemy's ally back stabbed him, I took the opportunity and persuaded him to end the war peacefully with no conditions.
Phew, so that was thing but now that's over we can get back to our normal lives in the papal states and celebrate our victory with our allies!

The reason was to keep this a secret was to prevent a panic in the server and also to not let the enemy to know about this
