Basically, when given the order to enter a discord server


[01-Aug-20 07:18 AM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
It is NOT A RAID, and should NOT be treated as such


[01-Aug-20 07:19 AM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
instead of spamming and trolling we will gain political influence


[01-Aug-20 07:19 AM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
and conquer the heretics without them even knowing it was a war

I went in out of curiosity


[01-Aug-20 07:21 AM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
and started getting back in good relations


[01-Aug-20 07:21 AM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
I got along with the server owner and was welcomed back


[01-Aug-20 07:21 AM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
I looked around a bit though, and found sinister forces trying to gain power in the server

one theory is that the server owner fakes the IP check due to a rivalry between the Xylum minecraft server and the Realpolitik minecraft server(that the ally plays)

[24-Aug-20 03:42 PM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
it is still not an atheist server
