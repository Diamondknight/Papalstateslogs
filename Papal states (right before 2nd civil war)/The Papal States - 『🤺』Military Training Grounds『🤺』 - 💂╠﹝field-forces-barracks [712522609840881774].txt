Hello


[03-Jul-20 08:13 AM] Alk Fouq de Geys#5552
I came to become a recruit.


[03-Jul-20 10:15 AM] Alk Fouq de Geys#5552
How do we rank ?


[03-Jul-20 10:31 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@Alk Fouq de Geys yeah


[03-Jul-20 10:31 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
We need to get some generals


[03-Jul-20 10:31 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Etc


[03-Jul-20 10:31 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
To train


[03-Jul-20 10:35 AM] Alk Fouq de Geys#5552
Glory to the State, Glory to the Pope, ave Maria.
With all the respects I due thee Domine, can I ask you what is the regular training ?


[03-Jul-20 11:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@Alk Fouq de Geys hm its roleplay you have to do laps fight each other pushups


[03-Jul-20 11:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
For example


[03-Jul-20 11:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
*pushup 1*


[03-Jul-20 11:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
*lap 1*


[03-Jul-20 11:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Basically roleplay


[03-Jul-20 11:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And then in the end


[03-Jul-20 11:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
U do this


[03-Jul-20 11:37 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Pls fight (person name)


[03-Jul-20 01:34 PM] Alk Fouq de Geys#5552
I think the regular stuff every soldier should have has to be : 
-a poncho that you can turn into a tent
-some strings
-a stove
-an axe and a shovel
-a knife
-a rifle
-military shoes as well as a uniformed dress


[03-Jul-20 01:34 PM] MEE6#4876
GG @Alk Fouq de Geys, you just advanced to level 2!


[04-Jul-20 10:21 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@Alk Fouq de Geys mhm

Good that he left the regular stuff so vague and not had any specification


[04-Jul-20 11:00 AM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
There is a small chance that everyone will buy the same brand and type of stuff


[04-Jul-20 11:49 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Hm


[04-Jul-20 11:50 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Should I make that item


[04-Jul-20 11:50 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
In shop


[04-Jul-20 12:24 PM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
I mean


[04-Jul-20 12:24 PM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
Get the people who make such stuff


[04-Jul-20 12:25 PM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
I think that at first we won't need a uniform


[04-Jul-20 12:25 PM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
Just something like an armband


[04-Jul-20 12:26 PM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
But once we get a province


[06-Jul-20 12:44 AM] Alk Fouq de Geys#5552
@𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯 I can technically give a province to the Papal States, my ancestors were counts of the Valentinois (France), for now, there’s no other pretendants to this title, I can technically give a part of it, in exchange of some money...


[06-Jul-20 12:51 AM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
Good


[06-Jul-20 12:51 AM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
But still


[06-Jul-20 12:51 AM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
I meant like a province in the Holy Land


[14-Jul-20 10:50 AM] Alk Fouq de Geys#5552
> Good that he left the regular stuff so vague and not had any specification
@𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯   I am not here to decide.


[14-Jul-20 11:00 AM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
Yeah


[14-Jul-20 11:00 AM] 𝔊𝔩𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔬𝔲𝔰 ℭ𝔯𝔲𝔰𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯#5373
I know


[23-Jul-20 11:47 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@🗝️⚔️🗝️Marshal of the Papal Armed Forces🗝️⚔️🗝️ @🗝️🏇🗝️Marshal of Papal Cavalry🗝️🏇🗝️ @🗝️👑🗝️Marshal of The Pontificial Swiss Guard🗝️👑🗝️ @🗝️⚓🗝️Admiral of the Papal Navy🗝️⚓🗝️ ok when you hold trainings, I suggest that you go to #📢╠﹝military-announcements and ping your respective branch and say "(Sailors/swiss guard/infantry men/Horsemen) Those who are attending the training session react to the message with ✅ to tell that you will be attending the training, If someone who reacts with ✅ to the message and does not appear for training will be given a warning."


[23-Jul-20 11:48 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
You can tell me the soldier's name who did not attend training and I shall give him a warning


[23-Jul-20 11:03 PM] Alexandrina Victoria#1647
Okay
