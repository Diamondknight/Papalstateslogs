[20-May-20 12:13 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
When speaking to High Ranks (Nuns, Cardinal Deacons, Cardinals and above, Generals and Admirals in military):
Instead of "Yes", say "ita"
Instead of "No", say "Nihil"
Instead of "Yes Sir!", say "ita Domine!"
Instead of "Sir", say "Domine"
Respect everyone regardless of their ranks.
When you see @Pope Benedict XV @lilKing typing in chat:
Say "Glory to the state, Glory to the pope, ave Maria"
Don't argue with the pope you can only give him advise and suggestions.
When you talk to members of the @—🗝️⛪🗝️College Of Cardinals🗝️⛪🗝️— you have to call them as 'monsigneur'
