•Here you can pass bills just like the cardinals. But the bill will have to go to the higher level (the Roman Curia) to get approved.

•People who are active in passing bills and active in the council will be choosen as a
  candidate for mayorship or you could just dm me if you want to be a candidate (total 5) or 
  your name could be given by the people and if you are choosen in the Elections you shall be    
  given the @Legate of Papal Mainland role(your job is to maintain law and Order in the city and you  
  will be also be considered as the head of the council)

The 1st bill is for giving free money in between €20-€100 every Sunday to guarantee the citizen's living and cut their cost of living.


[04-Jun-20 10:05 AM] Otto#2219
Also, that means we need a new bot.

[05-Jun-20 02:06 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Those who have jobs earn money

The bill is changed.


The 1st bill is to guarantee the stability of a citizen when they still don't have a stable income.


[05-Jun-20 10:27 AM] Otto#2219
Example, before they're given their first paychecks, they'll be given 50€ every Sunday.


[05-Jun-20 10:28 AM] Otto#2219
After they got their first paycheck, it's on their own.
