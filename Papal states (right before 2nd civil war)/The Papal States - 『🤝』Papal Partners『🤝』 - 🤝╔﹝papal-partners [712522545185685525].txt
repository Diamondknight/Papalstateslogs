> :face_with_monocle:**〔Organized Server〕**

> :robot:**〔Bots/Custom Bot〕**

“Conservatism is a settled conviction that we’re given certain goods like truth, beauty and justice that we ourselves didn’t acquire, but are privileged to pass on. Society is, as Edmund Burke would say, a contract between the living, the dead, and the yet-to-be-born."

With a centring on conservatism, we are a broad intellectual server that seeks to give a platform for debate that anyone can join on. 

All are welcome - we encourage those with differing views to check us out and challenge others in civilised debate!

The Kingdom of France is a historically themed Discord Server intended for just about anything. People can talk about anything they wish here.

The Server isn't modelled after the Kingdom of France itself, but is modelled after several historical eras and empires. This role-play server allows you to choose a Kingdom to which you can belong to. In this Kingdom, you're allowed to rank up and to earn even the highest position.

The purpose of this system is reflected in the bot, where the bot (Which I am currently programing) allows for war commands where different Kingdoms can war with each other. Through war, the Kings/Emperors of each Kingdom/Empire can become the Owner of the server. Changing the name of the server to whichever Kingdom/Empire he rules. Right now, France is in the lead.

Here are some things we Love to talk about here:

- History. A lot of us here love History, any historical topic may be discussed. History is the topic most discussed.
- Movies. I really love movies, and it sucks we're quarantined. Let's make up for it by talking about movies.
- Controversial Opinions are allowed, people will be told however to back done if they go to far.
- Programers are highly welcomed, I am programing a bot and any help would be of use.
- Minecraft players are highly welcomed to. I am currently building Constantinople on Bedrock.
- Talk about anything, you're welcome to. I am about as tolerant as you can find among Discord Server owners.

Kingdoms/Empires that exist: France, Russia, Austria, Egypt Pashahate of Muhammad Ali, Spain and Wallachia.

When you do join, make sure to verify! Have a great day and enjoy your stay if you join!

The Palace of Kings

The server aesthetic is inspired by Huey Long, cus he’s awesome.

To be perfectly honest, we’re mostly a hangout server. 

Political and Historical discussion is a pretty big topic here.
Artistry and Shitposting is another thing to do, though they’re not as big of a trending topic as the last two.

This place started off as a Roleplay server, then that kinda died off so... I turned it into a hangout server. It’s kinda just been vibin here for a while, not much activity recently (I plan on making some changes to end that).

To close this information bit off, this server is still trying to find it’s identity, it’s not finished.. a development process that’s taken months so far.
I hope you have a good time here, I hope you like the reforms (for the veterans), and EVERY MAN A KING!

The Abbasid Caliphate was the third caliphate to succeed the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It was founded by a dynasty descended from Muhammad's uncle, Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib (566–653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name. They ruled as caliphs for most of the caliphate from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, after having overthrown the Umayyad Caliphate in the Abbasid Revolution of 750 CE (132 AH). The Abbasid Caliphate first centred its government in Kufa, modern-day Iraq, but in 762 the caliph Al-Mansur founded the city of Baghdad, near the ancient Sasanian capital city of Ctesiphon. The Abbasid period was marked by reliance on Persian bureaucrats (notably the Barmakid family) for governing the territories as well as an increasing inclusion of non-Arab Muslims in the ummah (national community). Persianate customs were broadly adopted by the ruling elite, and they began patronage of artists and scholars. Baghdad became a centre of science, culture, philosophy and invention in what became known as the Golden Age of Islam.

This is an open forum Catholic discord server. This server is more theology based, and @John Gotti would like this server to be active in VC. All denominations and 'ism's are welcome. The only rule in this server is to love your neighbor as yourself (Mark 12:31). Everything you do in this server should reflect this rule. Humor, jokes, & memes are all welcome, but blatant disrespect will not be tolerated. Also if you scroll down in @John Gotti ‘s server, you will see text channels that contain quotes from the early church fathers that support every major catholic doctrine. Take some time to read up on them, and feel free to use them if you end up in a debate. Enjoy the server!!

Welcome to the Kingdom of Mareihaim. A mysterious island in the midst of the Atlantic Ocean and regarded as the centre of many legends such as Atlantis and Thule. A nation of warring Germanic clans unified under the leadership of the elected King and Six Great Clans who's origins are warped in mystery. Yet more danger awaits in the form of savage natives hiding in the deep ancient forests and secret valleys between giant icy peaks and fighting for centuries against the Gothic peoples to preserve their land, faith and way of life.

We are a roleplay and mock politics with a friendly and respectful community and a rich lore crafted by a motivated and intelligent team. Start a career in politics, become King or just live a normal life in the Kingdom of Mareihaim. In any case have fun in this great server !

Sincerely yours,

The team behind the Kingdom of Mareihaim

** ✠│Rhinese Authoratative Republic │✠**

The ✠│Rhinese Authoratative Republic │✠ is a political server with endless possibilities. It is commonly mistaken for a roleplay server, but that is not the main purpose. It is more of a political simulation. Almost everything here has a purpose other than roleplay.

We have :

**∞** :crossed_swords: An Army. Used for defending the server from harmful servers who may harm us.
**∞** :octagonal_sign: A border force. Used to only let secure accounts in the server.
**∞** :moneybag: Fully functioning economy.
**∞** :snake: A prison for rule breakers.
**∞** :hash: Many channels & fun roles!
**∞** :robot: Bots!
**∞** :thumbsup: Emojis
**∞** :speaking_head: Politics
**∞** :busts_in_silhouette: Government!

We are "Christianity"! Here is information about our server and what certain events, activities, and etc we provide as well as our various server aspects/features.

Christianity's mission statement: A religious community to provide discussion, education, support, and happiness to people of similar Christian beliefs and people on their road of holy discovery.

We aim to provide a holy place/educational server for people of the Christian belief and/or people of other religions. Our server consists of many great activities such as the following:
1. Debates. A great way to discuss and debate various beliefs whether they come from inside denominations of Christianity or other religions.
2. Sermons are educational/religious lectures given by preachers. A great way to familiarize yourself with more information of the Christian faith as well as experience what you would normally experience in your church.
3. Bible Study is a great way for some new christians to be able to learn about certain books/verses within the Bible. A great way to go into depth about certain biblical events. This is also a great way for people of other religions to get a profound understanding of the Bible.
4. Sometimes it is difficult for people to access a Church near them, whether it is closed due to irl-problems, such as the pandemic, or you don't have any near you. We offer Church services that allow you to experience Sunday services and other special religious events from right at home!

We also provide biblical-information for those wanting to be educated on Christianity. 
1. A channel dedicated to ask experienced Christians any questions you'd like. A great way to get an understanding of the specific aspects you'd like to be educated on.
2. Verse of the day allows people to learn parts of the Bible and educate themselves on the importance of the Bible.
