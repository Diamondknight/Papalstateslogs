@Tom_TRW how do I do that?


[21-May-20 01:31 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
We're trying to get this server restored, so right now we don't have enough of a player base to have another judge and Idk if the courts have even been set up


[21-May-20 01:31 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I'd talk to the Pontiff next time he's online and ask (He'll know more than me)


[21-May-20 01:32 PM] Minky#8720
Ah ok


[21-May-20 01:32 PM] Minky#8720
Hopefully if we get bigger then I may join the court system


[21-May-20 01:33 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I agree but you don't want to many offices and such for too small a server base (Many chiefs but not enough Indians as the saying goes)


[21-May-20 02:11 PM] Minky#8720
True

[27-May-20 07:04 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
So


[27-May-20 07:04 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
We should decrease


[27-May-20 07:04 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

In military?

Actually


[27-May-20 08:19 AM] Maid Ruby#7642
Why not


[27-May-20 08:19 AM] Maid Ruby#7642
When the server is bigger then you can add that much roles for military


[27-May-20 08:20 AM] Maid Ruby#7642
For now there is no need.to


[27-May-20 08:20 AM] Maid Ruby#7642
Have that much military roles


[27-May-20 08:20 AM] Tom_TRW#1610

[27-May-20 09:17 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@Maid Ruby I am thinking of removing the Corsican guard


[27-May-20 09:17 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And put


[27-May-20 09:17 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
The Swiss Guard


[27-May-20 09:17 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Like a separate branch


[27-May-20 09:34 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
I would also consider differentiating between the primary and passive roles, (Primary roles like verious jobs, careers and ranks not being too many) and passive roles like the autor oles (what age, either gender, ect)

1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 - Revised Standard Version (RSV)
<**16**> For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first; <**17**> then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord.

Nothing you say will get me to agree with your wars for pointless physical world territorial gain (All such secular gains are very temporary and less important, gaining souls isn't by the sword or force but by mission and spready the gospels, these spiritual gains are way more important to the church than the secularist modernist myths that are bound to the physical world.

[01-Jun-20 10:02 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Btw @Aureate Baron for however long I remain here, I've basically formed a Tridetine Traditional order, of clergy and laity here to preserve the Traditional Latin Mass divine worship and the old orders of faith and worship. You're welcome to join if you wish I'll start seeing about being promoted to clergy (in this church rp at least, in my own rp I'm ordained ) so I can start celebrating the Holy Mass of the Eucharist and not just the prayers here


[01-Jun-20 10:03 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
I mean if you want to invite me, you may


[01-Jun-20 10:04 PM] Tom_TRW#1610

Good Morning Your holiness


[01-Jun-20 11:07 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I did have a question, how does one get promoted from a Deacon to Priest (To be able to celebrate the Holy Eucharist in the traditional Tridentine mass)


[01-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
U have to hold daily prayers in the church and that's how you get a promotion


[01-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Oof ok, don't know if you saw but I'm organizing a traditional order to preserve the Tridentine Traditional mass and will be doing ultra-traditional masses when possible


[01-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Or like help others to hold masses etc etc (or help in probably the Coronation of Pius xi which is supposed to be held normally on Sunday but am thinking of holding it on Friday :p


[01-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
It won't be every day since my own rp church in another community comes first but I'll try to make it constant


[01-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

It says right there: Anti Revisionist
We don't allow Anarchists


[03-Jun-20 02:13 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Marxism Leninism is my ideology


[03-Jun-20 02:13 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
It takes out the stateless part


[03-Jun-20 02:14 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
Yeah we are the PCP (ML)
That's not what Marxism Leninism is...


[03-Jun-20 02:14 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
Marxism Leninism states that the Proletariat should establish a Dictatorship in order to destroy the Bourgeoisie in order to build Socialism


[03-Jun-20 02:15 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
A dictatorship of the proletariat


[03-Jun-20 02:15 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
Once Socialist Construction is finished the State will disintegrate


[03-Jun-20 02:15 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
that is not a stateless society


[03-Jun-20 02:15 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
And Stateless Classless society in Higher Stage Communism


[03-Jun-20 02:15 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
If you think Higher Stage Communism has a State you haven't read Marx or Lenin


[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
I do not want higher stage communism


[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
I want a dictatorship of the proletariat


[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
Then you aren't a Marxist Leninist


[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
or in this case

[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
I can give you the Lenin quotes


[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Call me a Stalinist or a Maoist then


[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
I do not want stateless society


[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
That will never work


[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
But


[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
Stalin and Mao also wanted Higher Stage Communism...


[03-Jun-20 02:16 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
a dictatorship of the proletariat


[03-Jun-20 02:17 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Well neither of them got it did they?


[03-Jun-20 02:17 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
The Dictatorship of the Proletariat won't be needed when the Bourgeois Class is **dead**


[03-Jun-20 02:17 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
The State would serve no function


[03-Jun-20 02:17 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
No but you're still a working class state


[03-Jun-20 02:17 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
You're a Working class government, but no State


[03-Jun-20 02:17 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
A State has:


[03-Jun-20 02:18 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
How can you have a government with no state?


[03-Jun-20 02:18 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
Rather a State is, according to Marx: "the means of which One Class oppresses another"


[03-Jun-20 02:18 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
When there is no Class, there is no State


[03-Jun-20 02:19 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Was there class in the Soviet Union in 1945?


[03-Jun-20 02:19 AM] Deleted User#0000

[03-Jun-20 02:19 AM] MarxEngelsLeninStalinMao69#0070
Within the Party there were Capitalist Roaders


[03-Jun-20 02:20 AM] Mao Zedong#3925

[03-Jun-20 08:06 AM] O Corvo#8407
it depends


[03-Jun-20 08:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Because democracy has adversely changed and effected society, allowing for economic, social, and psychological deterioration of mankind‚Äôs civilizations including but not limited to physical weakening of humanity in a literal sense.


[03-Jun-20 08:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Therefore, we should go back to absolute monarchy and observe once more the system which guided humanity for centuries to success. Without a physical, mental, or social deterioration.


[03-Jun-20 08:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
*Yes*


[03-Jun-20 08:13 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Ergo, modern society‚Äîincluding democracy of all kinds‚Äîis to blame for their suffering. As such, in this time of crisis, we should rally and destroy the system which has brought ruination to generations of souls‚Äîliberating them from the shackles of democracy and capitalism. Removing the bondage, thereof, with a counter-revolution in favor of an absolute monarchy.


[03-Jun-20 08:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
*Like the Sanfedists style*


[03-Jun-20 08:16 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The legal and social justification thereby, is established as such that a massive resistance to the system can be made due to the current global circumstances. This is particularly due to the pandemic, food shortages, and the mounting amount of anti-status quo rhetoric‚Äîincluding political turmoil. Furthermore, the time to kill democracy and restore the birthrights of the many nobles-whose families guided humanity for decades and even centuries-to take their place.

That was due to famine and a lack of leadership. But remember, everyone who supports a revolution there is always someone who fights against that exact cause.


[03-Jun-20 08:18 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Society, as an existence, has been poisoned by democracy and republicanism.

Changes in history are made by minorities, not the majority of people. Such as the American Revolution, the English Civil War, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolutions


[03-Jun-20 08:20 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The masses were subject to the aggression of a minority who physically and literally fought the masses and status quo in the name of change.


[03-Jun-20 08:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well to be fair most Russians where against the Tsar holding most power. Though when it came to the monarchy it was less clear cut. But with the commies it was very clear. Most Russians didnt want a communist system.

Which is how the White Army manged to fight for 5(?) years against the Red army


[03-Jun-20 08:21 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

What matters is why we fight and whether it is just. The cause I have is just. Why we fight matters. And the world is going down in flames, a great era of tribulation must begin to cleanse the world of the plague which has caused ruination, which has displayed families and people, which has made poor the rich, which caused the suffering of millions, which has monotony and dullness, which has lead to an increase in depresssion and psychological disorders, and which has lead to the physical weakening of man.


[03-Jun-20 08:29 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
For the past years, I have been thinking, thinking and writing, of a time when democracy falls and absolute monarchy rises again in grand comeback. This here is our chance for success, our chance to return the world to sanity, to honor, to glory, to health, to well-being, to wealth, to tradition, to faith, to order, and to the way it once was when man prospered

The fall of America must and will come, soon after, the democracies of Europe. The time for change is now, in the era of pandemics, food shortages, panic and fear, and anti-status quo behaviors. We can not let this once in a century opportunity fall before us and then sit silently. We once ruled the world and we will once more after the fall of democracy, the fall of the status quo, the fall of sufferings which humanity has done to itself.


[03-Jun-20 08:32 AM] O Corvo#8407
uh..


[03-Jun-20 08:32 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Humanity shot itself in the foot. Even the great writers of the Enlightenment had ideas that a corrupted republican or democratic system could easily be worse than a monarchical system. As such, they must all go down with fury and effort of man. To save humanity we must destroy that which has caused us pain: socialism and democracy.


[03-Jun-20 08:34 AM] O Corvo#8407
uh


[03-Jun-20 08:34 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
It is only natural that death must come to democracy

[03-Jun-20 08:38 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The systems calling themselves leftism, capitalism, fascism, constitutionalism, national socialism, socialism, democracy, republicanism, and liberalism are all satanic at worst and heretical at best


[03-Jun-20 08:38 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

[03-Jun-20 09:07 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I looked up the credentials required to become a Prince


[03-Jun-20 09:07 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Oof


[03-Jun-20 09:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Apparently, you can be a Prince as long as: 
-You are a Male ruler
-You are the heir to a sovereign nation
-You are the claimant to a throne
-You are the claimant to a royal or noble household
-You are a Male-Heir in a noble or royal household


[03-Jun-20 09:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Those are the general terms, you only need 1 to be considered a Prince


[03-Jun-20 09:10 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Nice


[03-Jun-20 09:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Which explains why some people has titles like ‚ÄúPrince of Bismarck‚Äù‚Äîbecause they are the heir to the House of Bismarck, regardless of the lack of land


[03-Jun-20 09:10 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Oof


[03-Jun-20 09:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Definitionally speaking, that makes me a Prince


[03-Jun-20 09:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
In European terms, at least


[03-Jun-20 09:10 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
In rp or real life?


[03-Jun-20 09:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Real life


[03-Jun-20 09:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I don‚Äôt like roleplays, you know that


[03-Jun-20 09:11 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Oof nice, though the Noble houses aren‚Äôt what they use to be


[03-Jun-20 09:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
It is very disappointing I know


[03-Jun-20 09:12 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
But modern nobility is a minority, nobility has always been a minority


[03-Jun-20 09:12 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
So unfortunately there is not much that can be done in the way of improving lives of ourselves and others


[03-Jun-20 09:12 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
I mean all of the German noble houses are no more than a social title and club and often to maintain their family‚Äôs home for tourists


[03-Jun-20 09:13 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Quite frankly, I blame that solely on democracy for making everyone equal regardless of credentials and capability of leadership


[03-Jun-20 09:13 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Both prices, dukes, lords ect


[03-Jun-20 09:13 AM] Tom_TRW#1610

[03-Jun-20 09:14 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
If we had monarchy, I would be a more effective and less corrupt leader than the majority of politicians which is just a gaggle of lawyers and elitists


[03-Jun-20 09:14 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Facts, It‚Äôs sad how some assort a free society and democracy are interchangeable


[03-Jun-20 09:15 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Yes, it is highly disappointing and distasteful how it all works out


[03-Jun-20 09:15 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Democracy has contributed to people becoming weak physically and mentally


[03-Jun-20 09:15 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Idk if you were here doing the democracy debate but one of the strongest arguments against democracies and republics are that politicians only work for the next election and don‚Äôt have the ability to think long term


[03-Jun-20 09:15 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Especially if you consider the 3rd wave feminist movement


[03-Jun-20 09:15 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Facts


[03-Jun-20 09:16 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Yeah, politicians only have to say what is trendy and popular all the time and just support whatever idea is popular


[03-Jun-20 09:16 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
They are unscrupulous and uncaring, all they want is money and power


[03-Jun-20 09:16 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Representatives will try buying elections with handouts and social programs not caring if it‚Äôs stupidly expensive and unstable and harmful


[03-Jun-20 09:16 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
They have an in capability of higher cognitive planning other than until the end of their term or possibly plans for future terms


[03-Jun-20 09:17 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
That‚Äôs why I refuse to vote and am staunchly against democracy


[03-Jun-20 09:17 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
A vote doesn‚Äôt affect elections, elections effect votes


[03-Jun-20 09:17 AM] Tom_TRW#1610

[03-Jun-20 09:20 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
I mean even Russia‚Äôs doing better off since it‚Äôs a sort of elected autocrat, so they don‚Äôt have all the same stupid policies we do


[03-Jun-20 09:20 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Besides they‚Äôre still held accountable by votes without the messy republican system


[03-Jun-20 09:21 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Russia has heavy censorship and a lack of ability to truly exert influence on others with the exception of themselves and their neighbors


[03-Jun-20 09:21 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Which they have a grip on


[03-Jun-20 09:22 AM] Tom_TRW#1610

Since they have a history of anti-socialism


[03-Jun-20 09:24 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Besides with how rapidly the Russian Orthodox Church is growing shows how rich the spiritual soil is after so much suffering

Yeah, it happens, you're to worried about making this place active, you can't artificially make this place active (Can't force people to be active and or stay around (discord servers are a private sector thing and in the free market participation is only voluntary)


[03-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Eh


[03-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

I mean it's the truth of discord servers, it's a private sector thing and you can't force people to join and can't force them to be active but it's only based on voluntary participation

Where I was in the admins


[03-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I don't recognize a single "Socialist" government rp as real


[03-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
If only I was a clergy so I could host Holy Mass


[03-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
U don't recognize anything as real lmao


[03-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
U are part of the clergy btw


[03-Jun-20 11:58 PM] King Edward I#2029
What do you guys think of a weekly mass on sundays?


[03-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Good


[03-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I recognize other rp countries, just not socialist ones (have a right to refuse to participate with private sector entities if I want)


[03-Jun-20 11:58 PM] King Edward I#2029
I will hold masses every Sunday


[03-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
And I'm a deacon in this rp and thus can't consecrate the elements


[03-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

[03-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Aureate Baron#3778

[04-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
9 am mass 12 pm and 5 pm?


[04-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
I mean there are bots where if a youtube channel's streaming it sends a notification, we could be lazy and find a traditional mass stream and use that


[04-Jun-20 12:00 AM] King Edward I#2029
Sounds good


[04-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
That‚Äôs getting popular now


[04-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

[05-Jun-20 11:49 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Democracy shouldn‚Äôt be an option


[05-Jun-20 11:49 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Democracy is a Hersey that should of been crushed centuries ago


[05-Jun-20 11:50 PM] King Edward I#2029
The college of cardinals is so corruption doesn‚Äôt fill the papacy


[05-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Sk√°kir#6746
Democracy works for local town on how to plan projects and such, not for governing


[05-Jun-20 11:50 PM] King Edward I#2029
A select group of cardinals pick a pope, that seems better than just picking them


[05-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Sk√°kir#6746
"What should we allocate resources too? Sho should represent us when asking the Pope for things"


[05-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Sk√°kir#6746

[05-Jun-20 11:51 PM] King Edward I#2029

The College of Cardinals should be the only ones to select and pick a candidate


[05-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
To become the Pope


[05-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
I think the Pope should have a hereditary or appointed heir


[05-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Hmm


[05-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Yes, there should be someone who is favored by the Pope


[05-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
A papal monarchy would work


[05-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Isn‚Äôt the Papacy already a monarchy?


[05-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
It is an elected monarchy


[05-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Meaning that electors (cardinals) vote for who should be the monarch (Pope)


[05-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
I am proposing a traditional absolute monarchy


[06-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
In which an heir is selected by the eldest male ruler (usually the monarch) ((The Pope))


[06-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Hm.


[06-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
> I dislike democracy
@Aureate Baron 
I like the idea of a senate that makes an contitutionally absolute monarch


[06-Jun-20 12:00 AM] King Edward I#2029
Do we have a college of cardinals yet?


[06-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
That means that he can do fuck all within the base rules


[06-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
> Do we have a college of cardinals yet?
@King Edward I idk


[06-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Reasonably, republicanism and democracy should be done away. Such as in the cases of elected monarchy mascaraedimg as a true monarchy


[06-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
> Do we have a college of cardinals yet?
@King Edward I  Yes


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
My uncle Fetsch is a cardinal


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] King Edward I#2029
Cool


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Constitutional Monarchism is literally Democracy with Extra Steps


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] King Edward I#2029
How do you become cardinal under this pope?


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Uh idk


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
We should abolish all forms of democracy and republicanism


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
As well as capitalism and communism


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Wut


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
And use a traditional system


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Feudalism is ass tho


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Feudalism is good


[06-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Nah


[06-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

[06-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Mostly being active and being loyal


[06-Jun-20 12:02 AM] King Edward I#2029
Ok

I am also an aristocrat irl


[06-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

[06-Jun-20 12:02 AM] King Edward I#2029
Sucks there‚Äôs no tests or crusades to prove loyalty


[06-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Freedom can be attained through monarchy


[06-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
This is why i kidnapped a pope and got excommunicated


[06-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
More so than democracy


[06-Jun-20 12:03 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
im going to eat for now


[06-Jun-20 12:03 AM] King Edward I#2029
Good

Democracy gives the illusion of freedom


[06-Jun-20 12:03 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361

@some wannabe mapper correct, Liberty is not a one way street which democracy maintains


[06-Jun-20 12:04 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
Yeah


[06-Jun-20 12:04 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Other means can be used to attain such luxuries


[06-Jun-20 12:04 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
~~Nazism~~


[06-Jun-20 12:04 AM] Sk√°kir#6746
Democracy is so everyone has a small amount of freedom to take each others freedom away


[06-Jun-20 12:04 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Nazism is just jingoistic socialism with extra steps


[06-Jun-20 12:04 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
Yeah


[06-Jun-20 12:04 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
@Sk√°kir it makes everyone matter less


[06-Jun-20 12:05 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
By dividing the power too much


[06-Jun-20 12:05 AM] King Edward I#2029
Why do we have so many watching bots?


[06-Jun-20 12:05 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
If one person has all the power then more effective means of bureaucracy can be used


[06-Jun-20 12:05 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Meanwhile, in a democracy it relies on the many‚Äîwhich are usually uneducated and uncultured


[06-Jun-20 12:05 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
America is a great example on how Democracy failed


[06-Jun-20 12:05 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
> I am Roman Catholic
@Aureate Baron 
O my great grand mother was catholic.  Im the only atheist to ever exist in my entire family history

Thank you Benito


[06-Jun-20 12:06 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
Oh uh welcome i guess


[06-Jun-20 12:06 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

My grandpa and great grandmother and Catholics, everyone else I k ow in my family is a Protestant and as far as I know I'm the only Orthodox


[06-Jun-20 12:06 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
~~is Atheism really a religion and not just a belief?~~


[06-Jun-20 12:06 AM] King Edward I#2029
America is a republic not a democracy


[06-Jun-20 12:06 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
It is the lack of a belief@some wannabe mapper


[06-Jun-20 12:06 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
@King Edward I Yes a Republic Democratic nation


[06-Jun-20 12:07 AM] Sk√°kir#6746
Republic means you have no king, democracy means you vote


[06-Jun-20 12:07 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
@Akbar the Great oh i see


[06-Jun-20 12:07 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Atheism is not a religion or single belief but rather philosophy


[06-Jun-20 12:07 AM] Sk√°kir#6746
It's a Democratic Republic


[06-Jun-20 12:07 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
Islam is more of a ideology then a religion


[06-Jun-20 12:07 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Democracy and Republicanism are both failures


[06-Jun-20 12:07 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Christianity was too


[06-Jun-20 12:07 AM] King Edward I#2029
Why would atheists be aristocrats in the Papal States though, seems a bit ironic


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Every major religion was a few centuries of rise to power and then hissy-fit before decline


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
@Aureate Baron Republicans are better then Democratics kinda


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Like Christianity


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
Yeah


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Islam is where Christianity was in the 1200‚Äôs


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Catholics are christians mate


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
So therefore


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Islam is 800 years behind modern society

[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Considering the modern world is awful


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Sk√°kir#6746
Catholicism, Protistantism, and Orthodoxy are all just different types of christianity


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Muslims are homophobic child rapers.


[06-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

[06-Jun-20 12:09 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311

[06-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I mean they correct technically speaking


[06-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
They do. Just one is a slave to his own prophet> I dont like how people say Islam and Christianity share the same God
@some wannabe mapper


[06-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Because Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all pray to the same God which Abraham prayed to


[06-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Meaning that technically


[06-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
They aren‚Äôt entirely incorrect


[06-Jun-20 12:10 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311

[06-Jun-20 12:46 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Man these leftist and secularist/fake religion followers would absolutely hate my rp church if they knew about it. Ultra traditionalist, refuses to have anything to do with fake non Christian religions, rejects leftist deforms ‚Äúreforms‚Äù like accepting homosexuality, women clergy and rejecting other things, keeping Devine litergy and not the modernist rubbish


[06-Jun-20 12:46 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Ect


[06-Jun-20 12:46 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Like that


[06-Jun-20 12:46 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Facts


[06-Jun-20 12:46 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Anyway, there are reasons I keep that rp separate from here Jesse for good reasons


[06-Jun-20 12:46 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Well


[06-Jun-20 12:46 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I mean 1 there‚Äôs me


[06-Jun-20 12:47 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
And 2 there‚Äôs them


[06-Jun-20 12:47 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
And 3 you don‚Äôt want to mix the first to with your rp


[06-Jun-20 12:47 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Dude how dare u diss lesbian anime


[06-Jun-20 12:47 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Also 4 you probably would hate the result of any of the 1st 3 occurring


[06-Jun-20 12:47 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Lol true, but even if they knew it‚Äôs name they might ‚Äòinvade‚Äô to liberate it from ultra traditionalism or some rubbish


[06-Jun-20 12:48 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Besides it‚Äôs not a thing if it self and I don‚Äôt want it or the rp nation it‚Äôs apart of to be tainted by the socialist bs of that retard named Marx


[06-Jun-20 12:49 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Anyway


[06-Jun-20 12:49 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Well you know what


[06-Jun-20 12:49 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Reject capitalism


[06-Jun-20 12:49 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Reject socialism


[06-Jun-20 12:49 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
But more importantly


[06-Jun-20 12:49 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
The flag in my profile pics the most they‚Äôll get to know


[06-Jun-20 12:49 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Reject modernism


[06-Jun-20 12:50 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Facts, the church supersedes any earthly authority on doctrine and isn‚Äôt subject to modernist and secular beliefs


[06-Jun-20 12:51 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Dude when will you learn that religion is a belief and is subject to criticisms like everyother belief


[06-Jun-20 12:52 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Separation of church and state is a rubbish idea, ( clearly since my rp nation‚Äôs flag has both the Cross in the center and the Jerusalem cross on it off to the side) but secular authorities have no ability to force their dumb and sinful beliefs on the church and the church can‚Äôt force conversations


[06-Jun-20 12:52 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
If i cant preach my beliefs neither can you. You may prosecute people for as long as you wish but you cannot force people to follow your beliefs


[06-Jun-20 12:53 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
And secularism doesnt even affect you. It just allows for freedom of personal beliefs


[06-Jun-20 12:53 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Secularism is literally the separation of Church from state


[06-Jun-20 12:53 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Yes it is


[06-Jun-20 12:54 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
So how would it not allow for freedom of personal beliefs


[06-Jun-20 12:54 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
that sounds like modernist propaganda


[06-Jun-20 12:54 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
The church has no authority on those who do not submit to their beliefs


[06-Jun-20 12:54 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
It  is like saying being a Muslim is mandatory in the Ottoman Empire


[06-Jun-20 12:54 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
it was the state religion, but there were hundreds of thousands of Christians and Jews


[06-Jun-20 12:54 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
which also had equal legal rights


[06-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
If you werent you would get discriminated against


[06-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
In practive


[06-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
I never said that Pete I‚Äôm saying secularists can‚Äôt force me or the church to move an inch on my traditional views, liturgical practices and bibical truth that Only Christians are saved not all those stupid fake religions, Also separate of church and state is a stupid idea


[06-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
But not in reality


[06-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Ok> I never said that Pete I‚Äôm saying secularists can‚Äôt force me or the church to move an inch on my traditional views, liturgical practices and bibical truth that Only Christians are saved not all those stupid fake religions, Also separate of church and state is a stupid idea

[06-Jun-20 12:57 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
So much for going to bed lol


[06-Jun-20 12:57 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
You cant use to bible to prove the bible


[06-Jun-20 12:57 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Thats circular explaination


[06-Jun-20 12:57 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
That‚Äôs the best you can come up with?


[06-Jun-20 12:57 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
Your arguments are invalid


[06-Jun-20 12:58 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Ok how are my arguments invalid


[06-Jun-20 12:58 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
> You cant use to bible to prove the bible
@Akbar the Great 
That is a fundamentally flawed source

@Akbar the Great


[06-Jun-20 12:59 AM] Akbar the Great#6870
> What arguments are you saying are invalid
@Tom_TRW 
About the separation of church and state


[06-Jun-20 12:59 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
So wait how does theology of the scripture play into this?


[06-Jun-20 01:01 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
And yes I know the various arguments fallacies but saying the Bible‚Äôs wrong dispute the supernatural reality of the Scripture and the historical backing don‚Äôt say how believing in the separation of church and state is rubbish, a sort of non argument really


[06-Jun-20 01:02 AM] Cartello del CIFM#1616
p i n g


[06-Jun-20 01:02 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Trying to take a gripe at people dare believing in the supernatural to try arguing a different category of debate Petey


[06-Jun-20 01:02 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
It‚Äôs like saying, I once had a bad experience at chick fil a so now I hate all farmers


[06-Jun-20 01:03 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
The points of separation between the two is a great value


[06-Jun-20 01:06 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Besides I don‚Äôt need to prove the scriptures Is fully true to get permission to personally believe the Christians supernatural belief is an absolute fact and not just possible where logically if I believe the supernatural truth of the Christian faith than A logical extension is believing the state is subject the God and all rights and earthly come from God and not just the mere earthly governments


[06-Jun-20 01:07 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
It‚Äôs not like I or other anti-modernist need permission to believe that the supernatural is a real fact and not like we need to justify it before getting permission (we have the right to believe whatever we want religions)


[06-Jun-20 01:08 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Anyway I‚Äôm heading to bed, nite your highness prince Jesse, nite Cardinal, Bishops, Priests, deacons, oh and nite petey whom left the debate

@everyone Sorry for the ping everyone but, happy 76th anniversary of D-Day. Right now, 75 years ago, 150 000 men, woman and children landed on Normandy beach. Allow us to reflect and be thankful to those who lost their lives on that beach for our freedom. RIP to every man, woman and child who fought and died in the D-Day landings. Let us not be thankful that they died, but be thankful that such people existed.

Tom


[06-Jun-20 11:21 PM] crud#0711
if you believe Christianity is the dominant religion


[06-Jun-20 11:21 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
You can believe and do what you want but salvation only comes through Christ's Church


[06-Jun-20 11:21 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Mhm

[06-Jun-20 11:22 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Just because it's popular doesn't mean it's true

[06-Jun-20 11:23 PM] crud#0711
how did god make earth


[06-Jun-20 11:23 PM] crud#0711
*caveman moment*


[06-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Again you can believe whatever fake religions and false teachings you want to believe but luckly no one can force us Traditionalist and true Christians from believing the truth and we have the utter right to believe even this offensive truth


[06-Jun-20 11:24 PM] crud#0711
how is this offensive


[06-Jun-20 11:25 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
To modernists and universalists saying only through Christ's church are saved is "offensive" to them or whatever rubbish


[06-Jun-20 11:26 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Traditionalist are real weird that's what I think c'mon times are changing


[06-Jun-20 11:27 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Lol you can think that but again nothing you say can force us from the traditionalist truth, you can't force people how to believe or think even if it's offensive to the dammed to hell followers of fake religions (all non Christian faiths)


[06-Jun-20 11:27 PM] crud#0711
actually i can


[06-Jun-20 11:27 PM] crud#0711
very simple and easy


[06-Jun-20 11:27 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
(Dammed to hell unless they leave those fake faiths for the Only True Faith rather)


[06-Jun-20 11:27 PM] crud#0711
hell does not exist you know


[06-Jun-20 11:28 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Lol of course someone like you would falsely believe that


[06-Jun-20 11:28 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Again you do you but nothing you say will make me leave the traditional Christian truth


[06-Jun-20 11:28 PM] crud#0711
not trying to make you become atheist, im saying obvious things


[06-Jun-20 11:28 PM] crud#0711
that most christians know


[06-Jun-20 11:30 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Dang


[06-Jun-20 11:30 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Lol I know more than I let on, I'm just saying nothing you're crying about is changing my mind, many modernists tried to convince me to leave the traditionalist Christian truth to their silly modernist and retarded whatnot and all failed


[06-Jun-20 11:30 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Just saying blanket statements like that or even trying to debate won't work


[06-Jun-20 11:30 PM] crud#0711
how am i trying to make you atheist


[06-Jun-20 11:30 PM] crud#0711
are you fucking retarded


[06-Jun-20 11:30 PM] crud#0711
if god has created everything,


[06-Jun-20 11:30 PM] crud#0711
literally everything,


[06-Jun-20 11:31 PM] crud#0711
why did he create other religions


[06-Jun-20 11:31 PM] crud#0711
surely to a christian mind like you, would think that anything god made is real


[06-Jun-20 11:31 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I never said you're making me an secularist I'm saying I'm not becoming a modernist (honestly just as stupid)


[06-Jun-20 11:31 PM] crud#0711
and if god loves everything, that means that other religions are real


[06-Jun-20 11:32 PM] crud#0711
im just going to let you think about this twice


[06-Jun-20 11:32 PM] crud#0711
im not trying to change your religious beliefs


[06-Jun-20 11:32 PM] crud#0711
nor am i trying to change your mind


[06-Jun-20 11:32 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
People may follow those fake gods but they're just earthly mirrors to the one true faith and will fade with the mortal earth (Not having the supernatural truth that The Holy Christian church has)


[06-Jun-20 11:32 PM] crud#0711
im simply stating this


[06-Jun-20 11:32 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Lol you're wasting your time modernist


[06-Jun-20 11:33 PM] crud#0711
lmao how


[06-Jun-20 11:33 PM] crud#0711
explain


[06-Jun-20 11:33 PM] crud#0711
i have all day every sundays arguing with christians just like you


[06-Jun-20 11:33 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
We Traditionalists aren't going anywhere and we'll continue to use our full religious liberty to continue to believe what we do


[06-Jun-20 11:33 PM] crud#0711
jesus fucking christ


[06-Jun-20 11:33 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Lol sounds like a personal problem


[06-Jun-20 11:33 PM] crud#0711
lol sounds like a retarded problem


[06-Jun-20 11:33 PM] crud#0711
do you live under a rock


[06-Jun-20 11:33 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I know how dare some people reject your modernist bs and decide for ourselves what we believe


[06-Jun-20 11:33 PM] crud#0711
"modernist"


[06-Jun-20 11:34 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Lol nah, well I mean with Coronavirus except for going to Mass


[06-Jun-20 11:34 PM] crud#0711
well if god created everything and loved people, why did he create that virus?


[06-Jun-20 11:34 PM] crud#0711
answer this question with a fucking answer


[06-Jun-20 11:34 PM] crud#0711
i dont want some denial statement


[06-Jun-20 11:35 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Lol what a pointless and juvenile statement but I'm not obligated to debate someone clearly uneducated as you so nah I'll be going afk to work on my own rp church (and yes it's very traditionalist)

lol the modernists here I don't take part in any secular activities here like voting, their pointless crusades for temporary power on this temporary earth among other things. You guys do you, but I'll fully ignore all that stuff and only focus on the Supernatural and theological

Why do we even have elections


[07-Jun-20 11:15 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
This is the Papal States, there are no elections


[07-Jun-20 11:16 PM] Alexandrina Victoria#1647
:TheChoosenOne:


[07-Jun-20 11:17 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Elections should be illegal


[07-Jun-20 11:18 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
The communist party is cheating


[07-Jun-20 11:18 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I got a feeling

[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
They didn't type there names


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Democracy is the illusion of choice. Everyone cheats to get ahead


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
That‚Äôs why it should be banned


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Well


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Idk


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
It just leads to corruption


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Aint pope


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Anymore


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
All democracy is is the oppression of the masses by the elite‚Äôs propaganda given to the masses


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
ü§∑


[07-Jun-20 11:20 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Therefore democratic systems should be dismantled


[07-Jun-20 11:20 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Because all they do is divide and mentally handicap people into a mindset of ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù


[07-Jun-20 11:20 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
There is no unity in democracy, there is no just cause in fighting for greed or avarice.


[07-Jun-20 11:21 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Democracy is just another lie told to everyone


[07-Jun-20 11:21 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Sometimes, we tell it to ourselves to convince ourselves we will be alright


[07-Jun-20 11:21 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Sometimes, we tell others because we want others to understand our point of view or to debate them


[07-Jun-20 11:21 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Sometimes, we tell it to ourselves because we want to believe the world could be a bette place by a few votes


[07-Jun-20 11:22 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
But reality shows that it not the case. Reality shows that disunity and mindlessness is rampant. Because we told to fight the enemy.


[07-Jun-20 11:23 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
It is also by capitalism and communism are both evil, they perpetuate a stigma against each other and individuals within society


[07-Jun-20 11:23 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
This is why the modern world must die a thousand deaths before we are saved from the unholy and uncouth system of mob rule aka democracy


[07-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Hey Jesse, you're right about that, however if you want to vote defiantly vote, you don't need to try impressing me but having similar views and personal choices I'm impressed by you already make your choices on your own will and not on my behalf


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Well you see


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
I like the works of Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes. So I am trying to warn others of the nature of democracy.


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
It would be sinful to not warn someone the dangers of something which they seek to engage in


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Because that could be seen as allowing them to do something with negative repercussions, purposely


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
So True mate, I just want ya to know you don't need to do and believe everything I do, I'm already quite impressed with ya mate


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Which, to be honest, is sinful


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
You should warn others of what they are doing and why it is bad, rather than just let them do whatever they want


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
You can‚Äôt stop people, but you surely can warn them


[07-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
So True


[07-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
So it is important to get the word out there about things


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
facts mate


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
democracy


[07-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
is easily corruptable


[07-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Precisely


[07-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
it gives power to the most unlikely of people


[07-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
She gets it


[07-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
and it causes disarray


[07-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
chaos


[07-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
The media doesn‚Äôt help the chaos


[07-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
**H**


[07-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Am a make a 4 party system for the next Elections


[07-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
power itself is dangerous


[07-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
State made parties :p


[07-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
democracy is a dumpster fire, the media is gasoline being poured on the dumpster, and the garbage is the politicians feeding the flames with their lies such as wood feeds a flame


[07-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
giving it to ‚Äúfree‚Äù people


[07-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
And the people are the flames


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Growing and rising as the fire gets larger


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Always aggressively hot and unable to cool down


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Powerful yet dangerous


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
yes


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Freedom within democracy is an illusion


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
percisely


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
I am sorry what?


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
If you vote for 1 party the other party will just block the progress of the winning one


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
And vise versa


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
it secures ‚Äúrights‚Äù


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
And you know who pockets all the money?


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
The politicians who were elected to make those ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Am a make 4 state made parties and abolish the rest


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
It is basically a poorly formed debate team that fights itself in the name of earning boat loads of cash


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
To reduce the chaos


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
That‚Äôs what democracy is


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
I am a politician out of Arizona. What proof or even fact do you have that democracy is evil? Don't use America because its an constitutional republic not a democracy.


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
America is democratic


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
The communists are cheating I reduced 5 suspicious votes from them


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Rn


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
America is constitutional


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
It changes over 70 years ago


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
God's party is leading


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Republicanism is a form of Democracy


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
You realise that, right?


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
Republicans are a mix of nationalists and members of conservative parties


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Infante Alfonso De Bourbon#8227
Hello Your Holiness


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
Democrats are evil liers


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
America is a capitalist nation which shows no respect to minorities and the poor


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Yes, it is not direct democracy. But it is republican


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I hope Bernie comes in power


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Infante Alfonso De Bourbon#8227
It‚Äôs corrupt


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
Republicans are not in the matter


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And that trump gets removed


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
Bernie is fucking evil


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
But America is a republic, making the government a republican government


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Chonky Orange boi


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
Bernie is only here for power


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
If it is not a republic


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Then what form of a democracy is it


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
It's Capitalism


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
You clearly do not know what a republic is


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Capitalism is economic


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Yes


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
Republican does not mean republic


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Yes it does


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
Republican is a party not a system


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Republicanism is literally the ideology of republics


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Brandon M. V. Childers#1963
You come back and talk to me when you know your politics

Also the GOP called themselves the Republican party named after the American Republic, they didn't create the republic. America's not a democracy it's a republic (long before the Republican party came about)


[08-Jun-20 12:07 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Republicanism is advocacy for a republic


[08-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Republicanism is an ideology that supports and upholds a republic style of government, For instance the French Republicans who fought against the French Monarchy


[08-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Democracy is advocacy for a democratic system or a democracy literally


[08-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Republicanism a form of democracy

Republicanism's a less stupid form of democracy


[08-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
As monarchist, I believe that all democracy is bad

[08-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I think that we need to follow the ideals of our ancestors and not forsake them


[08-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
As opposed to weaken ourselves and allow ourselves to be used by others


[08-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
lemme double check


[08-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
We must think for ourselves


[08-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
And act for ourselves


[08-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Republicanism's less stupid because they counteract the will of the people by checks and balances instead of a democracy where the people directly decide by simple majority


[08-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Rather than rely on the kindness of others, because not everyone will be kind and just. Which is why it is the duty of the Christian to bring justice and goodness to the world

I just saved the debate in this chat


[08-Jun-20 12:12 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
For Instance in the US's Republican governance It's not the people directly who rule but they elect representatives for each state, All elections in the US are state and local elections of one type or another. It's a sort of hybrid where the interests of the people are balanced with the interests with each state republic. For instance The US Presidential election's not a national election but a series of state elections where they elect the electoral college to then elect the president. It's a intresting system but still inheritly flawed as all democratic types of government


[08-Jun-20 12:12 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

Also Lava flows are quite scary since they're practically unstoppable, In a way to describe them, they keep flowing from the source and as lava's exposed to the air it cools but new lava flows under pushing the dry lava up and then keeps pushing forward


[08-Jun-20 12:19 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
You know Funny Story, we literally just watched that movie @Infante Alfonso De Bourbon

[08-Jun-20 12:21 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
But anyway, Lava flows are a sort of self making straw, they move forward, the top lava cools and hardens, and new lava flows in under the cool stuff to push up and forward even more


[08-Jun-20 12:21 AM] Tom_TRW#1610

@Pope Benedict XV Does that mean the Bible is extremist

As the Holy Catholic church we're supposed to be in the world but not of the world, our views, rights and ideologies come not from this mortal world and the sinful (most recent modernists) but directly from God

You may think the modern world is good but we have the right to be traditionalists no matter how much you pagans hate it


[09-Jun-20 12:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
are you saying we should not use systems and ideas given to us by God?


[09-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Huh those stupid people used to consider some women as 'witches' no such things exist


[09-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
You keep saying that but you only say it in a strawman way and not with any understanding not everyone thinks like you and believes what you do (Thanks be to God for that right)


[09-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
witches do exist


[09-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
not in the same sense as people think though


[09-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
people who do card reading, divinations, and such things like magic


[09-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
those are witches


[09-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
the Church says that magic and divinations are demonic and heretical powers


[09-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
There are great evils in the supernatural realm that exsist, it's not like just the physical world exists, there are demons, black magics servants of satan who will do whatever they can to drag people to the losing side (Satan already lost after all)


[09-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
and should be avoided


[09-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
so witches do actually exist, the Church supports this


[09-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
What supernatural things come not from God comes from the dark forces


[09-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Facts


[09-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The CCC and Bible point to this


[09-Jun-20 12:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
so if people do not recognize it, then they refuse to realize the doctrine of the Church


[09-Jun-20 12:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
you can not just pick and choose what you believe


[09-Jun-20 12:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
God gave you free will, but listening to only what you want to hear is objectively negative to a person


[09-Jun-20 12:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
and just people in general


[09-Jun-20 12:13 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
The main stupid thing about the modernists Jesse is they believe only the physical world exist even if they won't admit it, and will believe all the temporary things of the physical world that will die with the physical world on that Last Day. However for us who believe in The Supernatural church that exists beyond this physical world and in the Eternal Supernatural realm and put our focus on that Eternal Spiritual Church and not bend our will to the dying ideas of the physical realm will live in eternity while the modernists and their beliefs of the pysical realm will die with the pysical realm and all the fake non-Christian religions like islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, ect


[09-Jun-20 12:14 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Religions either focus too much on the physical world or too much on the spiritual world


[09-Jun-20 12:14 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Like Judaism and Islam (physical focus) or Buddhism and Hinduism (spiritual focus)

See even for those fake religions who focus too much on the spiritual world too much, their "religions" only exist on the physical world as mere made of things of mortal man, Christianity's the only real faith because it's a faith that exists both on the physical realm through the Saints and the Church but also in the Supernatural

Only Christianity's the true religion and only salvation comes through the Holy Christian religion, All fake religions are made up by mortal man and don't have any supernatural force or power guiding them (except the devil's dark magic to trick people to that fake religion)

Am a just punch someone


[09-Jun-20 12:21 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

As long as a single one of us Conservatives and Traditionalists have a discord or media leftists don't have any control (like my discord server) these leftsits are powerless to stop our views from spreading and converting people to real views and not empty leftist retardation


[09-Jun-20 12:21 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The rationality and reasonable nature of them always for it to spread fast

You see, Thomas, ideas can never die even if people do. Ideas are something that be thought about adapted, they supported for whatever reason they want. Even if an idea is silenced or suppressed, it will never die not in a million years. This is because ideas are up to individuals to decide, not government or military or another man.

Also it's funny you assume I like Trump just because I'm from Texas though as a leftist NPC I'm not surprised you judge people from aidentity politics point of views, I mean it was the Democratic party who founded the KKK, and other anti-black groups who judged them not as individuals but by their identity group, anti-women groups and whatnot


[09-Jun-20 12:34 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Almost like we should instead judge people as individuals by the contents of their characters and not the color of their skins like us Conservatives believe

This is why I hate democracy, it is contradictory and isn‚Äôt consistent


[09-Jun-20 12:36 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Also Conservatives: believes in economic policy that helps bring the people of color out of poverty via economic growth in their areas instead of the leftist ideology of pushing them down and having a dependency on government handouts insuring they're always poor

And I heard a rumor it was passed or something to do with public officials agreeing with it


[09-Jun-20 12:39 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
As long as even one of us Traditionalists exist the Traditional Mass will still be around (Fun Fact: according to recent polls, Youth and younger Catholics are going back to the Traditional Mass and rejecting the Modernist Novus Ordo "Worship")


[09-Jun-20 12:39 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
And Ikr


[09-Jun-20 12:39 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
It called the abolishment of the police

How silly


[09-Jun-20 12:40 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
I mean the police should be privatized anyway but anyway


[09-Jun-20 12:40 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
If it gets passed there will be revolutions in America

[09-Jun-20 12:43 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
It's named after Saint Thomas Aquinas (For his countless contributions to Traditional Theology)

I'm reformatting them will conversations of people here like Jesse to make this place more traditional again and fill the Basilica with Traditional Prayer and Mass

[09-Jun-20 01:16 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
You missed a lot mate, Me and Jesse were talking about Traditionalism and how we converted people to Traditionalism in some of our own discord servers, and Benny was trying to debate some and threaten us for being extremists and could shut down our views (even though he has no authority in our various discord servers and whatnot) but anyway


[09-Jun-20 01:16 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Aside that, not much


[09-Jun-20 01:16 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

There's no copy rights for rp servers, it's laughable ya'll think you can force others to stop rping somehow or force them into this little rp


[11-Jun-20 12:15 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
What's next for us running lassez-faire rp nations who reject all leftist policy will somehow next be on the not allowed rp list?


[11-Jun-20 12:18 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
At the end of the day even though that's a pretty crappy thing to do you don't own any copyright ownership to the name Vatican rp, or any of such thing, All rp nations and such are a private sector affair so the owners of said discord servers can run them however they want as long as no real laws (not rp laws since they aren't real laws) or the TOS isn't being broken

[11-Jun-20 01:06 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
(This is why he‚Äôll never know my rp nation‚Äôs name or anything except it‚Äôs a far-right passed-fairs free market and libertarian nation that completely rejects all leftism and the state church which is ultra traditionalist and rejects all modernism and he hates everything about it, since he doesn‚Äôt know where to find it there‚Äôs he‚Äôll try to take it over to bring the retarded cancer of leftism to the (redacted)‚Äôs state and modernist cancer to (redacted)‚Äôs church)


[11-Jun-20 01:11 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Traditionalism is close to nazism


[11-Jun-20 01:11 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Which gey


[11-Jun-20 01:14 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Anyway that kid Benny won‚Äôt know anymore than that I just said and the flag in my profile pic, can‚Äôt try to force his stupid beliefs and policy on something he doesn‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs at (not like he could do anything anyway since (retracted)‚Äôs a fully nationalist and is fully national sovereignties nation and all globalist, semi-international organization or government or any outside government of any kind have no say whatsoever on (retracted)‚Äôs policy. No matter what he believes or says he has absolutely no say over any political, policy, law or religious position of any kind no matter how much he hates it, he‚Äôs basically 100% powerless there

[15-Jun-20 01:43 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Communism and socialism function similarly and are therefore equally unviable.


[15-Jun-20 01:44 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The modernist poisons of the West would have you believe that democracy is your only salvation from this.


[15-Jun-20 01:44 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
This is false.


[15-Jun-20 01:45 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Democracy is a false god preached to us because ‚Äúeveryone matters‚Äù and ‚Äúthe majority run is the only authority‚Äù, these are leftist messages.


[15-Jun-20 01:46 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Democracy and Leftism are basically the same thing: they are said to be great and spoken of highly.


[15-Jun-20 01:47 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
But think about all the money the government pockets for itself, all of the suppression that occurs, and the total lack of ability to handle situations properly.


[15-Jun-20 01:47 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Then you have the rights calling your name: be a fascist, be a nazi! But what have they brought other than extreme law and order‚Äîwith a side of death.


[15-Jun-20 01:48 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
It would seem that Christianity and Monarchy are the only viable ideals suitable for mankind.


[15-Jun-20 01:49 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
They purge the ideas of capitalism and communism, they spite the concepts of modernism and fascism‚Äîand nazism, they support moral and just living, and they give meaning to a meaningless life

@Pope Benedict XV for me? two reasons: you can have more contact with women, and as such increasing your chances of getting a girlfriend, and second make the class more dynamic

Is Pope Pious XI just a figurehead?


[15-Jun-20 11:31 AM] King Edward I#2029
Because the retirement of Pope Benedict XV feels incomplete, as the retired pope still holds huge power over the server after retiring.

I think you should make it official, instead of saying you are no longer pope

Either you are still pope or not


[15-Jun-20 11:24 PM] King Edward I#2029

[21-Jun-20 07:04 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

[21-Jun-20 07:05 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Hm?


[21-Jun-20 07:05 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

Eh he will keep debating about it


[21-Jun-20 07:06 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And btw


[21-Jun-20 07:06 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Pope's are also elected


[21-Jun-20 07:06 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
So it ain't heresy


[21-Jun-20 07:06 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
So now ü§´

[21-Jun-20 07:06 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Ok


[21-Jun-20 07:07 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Do you know anything of the history of the Christian Church?


[21-Jun-20 07:07 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Honestly.


[21-Jun-20 07:07 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
If this was the Papal States, heresy would be banned


[21-Jun-20 07:07 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Yet you engage in it for activity.

For something you want


[21-Jun-20 07:08 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
We are not in 1110s


[21-Jun-20 07:08 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Heresy should be banned


[21-Jun-20 07:08 AM] O Corvo#8407
lol


[21-Jun-20 07:08 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Lol indeed


[21-Jun-20 07:08 AM] O Corvo#8407
what kind of?


[21-Jun-20 07:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
All kinds of heresy


[21-Jun-20 07:09 AM] O Corvo#8407
oh


[21-Jun-20 07:09 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
We don't allow nudity


[21-Jun-20 07:09 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
That's one thing


[21-Jun-20 07:09 AM] O Corvo#8407
yes


[21-Jun-20 07:09 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Why would you keep some forms banned and other unbanned


[21-Jun-20 07:09 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Am a go now


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
You can‚Äôt pick which Holy Scriptures to call ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù and others ‚Äúwrong‚Äù


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Hmm.


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
You are not God and can not make that decision

~~On Halloween am a dress up as Democracy and come to your house and spook you~~


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Democracy is the only ‚Äòsafe‚Äô system


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
To prevent dissent


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Democracy is heresy


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
As of now


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Not exactly


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Every system


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Has its flaws


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And it's goods


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The Bible does not endorse it


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I don‚Äôt care about flaws


[21-Jun-20 07:10 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
*inhales*


[21-Jun-20 07:11 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Eh


[21-Jun-20 07:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The Bible does not endorse it


[21-Jun-20 07:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
And advocates for theocracy or monarchy


[21-Jun-20 07:11 AM] O Corvo#8407

@Pope Benedict XV ~~cont me in~~

> And it's goods


[21-Jun-20 07:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Therefore the Bible has spoken on what should or should not be allowed


[21-Jun-20 07:11 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I have been pinged


[21-Jun-20 07:11 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
To not follow the Bible by choice is utter nonsense if you claim to be ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù


[21-Jun-20 07:11 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Oh no

^^


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@Marisa Kirasame ~~let him rant~~


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
If you want to ban things that are bad


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Ban heresy


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
hm


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
heresy IS bad


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Exactly


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Some things are good


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Some are bad


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Who are you to choose what is moral and what is not


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@Pope Benedict XV


[21-Jun-20 07:13 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Are you that high of a being


[21-Jun-20 07:14 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
That gets to decide what is heresy and what is not


[21-Jun-20 07:14 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
U do u


[21-Jun-20 07:14 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Who is good and who is not


[21-Jun-20 07:14 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
God will decide those things


[21-Jun-20 07:14 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Calm down @Aureate Baron


[21-Jun-20 07:14 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I am calm


[21-Jun-20 07:14 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
He‚Äôs just opting for democracy


[21-Jun-20 07:14 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
Because if we don‚Äôt


[21-Jun-20 07:14 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I have the capacity of a human's brain to decide what is good and what is not good day


[21-Jun-20 07:14 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
That is heresy


[21-Jun-20 07:15 AM] O Corvo#8407
> I have the capacity of a human's brain to decide what is good and what is not good day
@Pope Benedict XV good


[21-Jun-20 07:15 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
He‚Äôd have to face some dissent


[21-Jun-20 07:15 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
from some of the parties and stuff


[21-Jun-20 07:15 AM] O Corvo#8407
> That is heresy
@Aureate Baron ?! wot


[21-Jun-20 07:15 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
According the Catechism, the Bible is the only set of morals and ideals to follow


[21-Jun-20 07:15 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
You can add your own on to them but God‚Äôs law must always precede the laws of man


[21-Jun-20 07:15 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Because of the fact that God is above all men


[21-Jun-20 07:16 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@O Corvo u can continue debating but just do not ping me


[21-Jun-20 07:16 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
@Marisa Kirasame Democracy is worthless and pointless. Just popularity contests


[21-Jun-20 07:16 AM] O Corvo#8407
When I cite you that happens


[21-Jun-20 07:16 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Leadership involves caring and working hard with a set of morals and ideals


[21-Jun-20 07:17 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Not following what the majority want. You are expected to do what is right. If you do not then you will bear subject to the consequences thereof


[21-Jun-20 07:17 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I do right/ listen to my people


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I want to be like francis


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
He is a people's pope


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
francis


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
ok


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Doing what is right doesn‚Äôt mean following the majority, have you seen the modern world?


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
People think Jesuits are communists


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Just because they care for poor


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
You have to do what is morally right, not socially right


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Bruh


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Actually


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Both is good


[21-Jun-20 07:18 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
At some extent


[21-Jun-20 07:19 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Socially right is to a far less extent that moral


[21-Jun-20 07:19 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Rich boi got nitro


[21-Jun-20 07:19 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Morality is literally one of the most important things


[21-Jun-20 07:20 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Yeah and?


[21-Jun-20 07:20 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
@Pope Benedict XV I bought a stranger a gift yesterday


[21-Jun-20 07:20 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
It cost 7.99 and I did it for no real reason


[21-Jun-20 07:21 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Stop


[21-Jun-20 07:21 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

[21-Jun-20 07:21 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I pinged you once


[21-Jun-20 07:21 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

[21-Jun-20 07:21 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

[21-Jun-20 07:21 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I appreciate u for that


[21-Jun-20 07:21 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Ur helping other humans


[21-Jun-20 07:22 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Again, it is called morality


[21-Jun-20 07:22 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
If you don‚Äôt help others with the intention of getting nothing in return, that says something about your character


[21-Jun-20 07:23 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
@Aureate Baron your an interesting fellow, i‚Äôll give you that


[21-Jun-20 07:24 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I‚Äôm just a little religious, nothing really special


[21-Jun-20 07:24 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I‚Äôm pretty boring


[21-Jun-20 07:24 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
A little?


[21-Jun-20 07:26 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Well yeah


[21-Jun-20 07:26 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I would say I am pretty moderate


[21-Jun-20 07:27 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I‚Äôve met so really fanatical religious people. Besides that, I know people who are more religious than me, like Thomas‚Äîhe is more religious than me. But he is admirable and not like insane fanatics I have met. He is very religious compared to everyone here.


[21-Jun-20 07:28 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I mean I agree with him nearly constantly, but he is much more religious than me


[21-Jun-20 07:30 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Yep

So now I am being blamed for *something* which he won‚Äôt tell me


[21-Jun-20 07:40 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
He won‚Äôt even tell me what I did against him


[21-Jun-20 07:40 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
||Me: *whispers to myself* was that necessary||


[21-Jun-20 07:40 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
None of you are in the right


[21-Jun-20 07:40 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
but also none of you are in the wrong


[21-Jun-20 07:40 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
How does going to war solve that then


[21-Jun-20 07:40 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
||say hi if you click this||


[21-Jun-20 07:40 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
That just sounds like a waste of resources and time


[21-Jun-20 07:40 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
going to war creates opportunity for you to meet and speak through it


[21-Jun-20 07:41 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Human Resources are the most valuable, what do you gain from fighting us


[21-Jun-20 07:41 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I mean you could do that already


[21-Jun-20 07:41 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
War = destruction of your beloved server


[21-Jun-20 07:41 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Denmark has


[21-Jun-20 07:41 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Why can‚Äôt you


[21-Jun-20 07:41 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
you'd have no incentive to speak if there is peace


[21-Jun-20 07:41 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Unless u have good Protection


[21-Jun-20 07:41 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
An esponiage


[21-Jun-20 07:41 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

[21-Jun-20 07:41 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

[21-Jun-20 07:42 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
peace can never come until you both meet and start from the beginning

lactose intolerancy sucks


[21-Jun-20 07:42 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Our main shtick is that we never surrender


[21-Jun-20 07:42 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
And so is Guynne‚Äôs


[21-Jun-20 07:42 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
guynne is smart, he knows when to surrender


[21-Jun-20 07:42 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
He told me he doesn‚Äôt surrender


[21-Jun-20 07:42 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
he knows this is a winning battle for us, which is the issue.


[21-Jun-20 07:42 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@Aureate Baron @Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II if you want to talk diplomacy and about wat between Ur nations I will take you to my cottage there we can discuss


[21-Jun-20 07:42 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Properly


[21-Jun-20 07:43 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
He must be smart enough to know who he is fighting


[21-Jun-20 07:43 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
If one side keeps winning and the other keeps fighting, its an endless cycle


[21-Jun-20 07:43 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The probably is


[21-Jun-20 07:43 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
It ends in stalemate everytime


[21-Jun-20 07:43 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Every war is the same


[21-Jun-20 07:43 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
I'm going to put both of you in a group together


[21-Jun-20 07:43 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
and you guys can start from the beginning there


[21-Jun-20 07:43 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
That was done already 3 times


[21-Jun-20 07:43 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
In the past week


[21-Jun-20 07:43 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022

[21-Jun-20 07:44 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

[21-Jun-20 07:46 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Our war lasted like 3 months

This time


[21-Jun-20 07:46 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
unless moral is completely gone, you shouldnt nuke


[21-Jun-20 07:46 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
And it only ended because we both called it a stalemate


[21-Jun-20 07:46 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
And just gave it up

[21-Jun-20 07:48 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
Guynne threatened a raid?


[21-Jun-20 07:48 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
We tried to afflict minimum damage


[21-Jun-20 07:48 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
you'd have to really piss him off


[21-Jun-20 07:48 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
He was royally pissed off


[21-Jun-20 07:48 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
So we don't get banned

[21-Jun-20 07:48 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I asked him why he wants war


[21-Jun-20 07:49 AM] Aureate Baron#3778

In this one


[21-Jun-20 07:49 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I fight in the name of the defense of nation and honor


[21-Jun-20 07:49 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Once upon a time


[21-Jun-20 07:49 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
That‚Äôs why I fight


[21-Jun-20 07:49 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
@Aureate Baron you probably pissed off one of the UCLD states, which then overblew the story when reporting to Guynne.


[21-Jun-20 07:50 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
Guynne then initiated war or something, and a few more states got pissed off


[21-Jun-20 07:50 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
Same thing happens


[21-Jun-20 07:50 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I met him in February 2018 because Vlad from Vorkatia


[21-Jun-20 07:50 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
Then it escalates and information like ideologies come up, being two opposites both of you hate each other more


[21-Jun-20 07:50 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Voorkatia


[21-Jun-20 07:50 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The first time we met he seemed mildly hostile towards me


[21-Jun-20 07:50 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022

[21-Jun-20 07:50 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022

[21-Jun-20 07:51 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
In discord


[21-Jun-20 07:52 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
You accidently pissed off a UCLD, or members associated with you did. The story was then reported to Guynne, but inflated to cover something the state did.

[21-Jun-20 07:52 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
Guynne, seeing a state may have been attacked initiated war or some sort of defence thing


[21-Jun-20 07:52 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
This then gets repeaed over and over


[21-Jun-20 07:52 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
During this process, information about you two is revealed.


[21-Jun-20 07:52 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361

Yes


[21-Jun-20 07:53 AM] Marisa Kirasame#1361
what


[21-Jun-20 07:53 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
So essentially, basically, I was blamed as a scape goat for the mistake of someone from 2 years ago. And that‚Äôs why Guynne has decided to make me his mortal enemy which he must destroy


[21-Jun-20 07:53 AM] Deutscher Kaiser Wilhelm II#7022
@Aureate Baron Now we are here.


[21-Jun-20 07:53 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

Blm is a drangerous ideology

Discord censoring offensive speech, how adorably stupid and autocratic it those box trigglypuffs we on the right mock continuously


[22-Jun-20 12:59 AM] superiorob#1422
the BLM message that equality should be promoted and racism is not good is of course a good one but‚Äîpeople ruined it by looting and stuff


[22-Jun-20 12:59 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311
BLM is stupid


[22-Jun-20 12:59 AM] some wannabe mapper#1311

that quote from martin luther king jr is a very well said one, it‚Äôs a shame that radicalism had to ruin that message


[22-Jun-20 01:02 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
I don‚Äôt care what your skin color is, do you actually believe in your country or do you not?

Racist jokes are overrated


[22-Jun-20 01:05 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Racism towards white people is equally sinful and unjust as it is towards the black and people of color communities, no one should be judged collectively by their identity group but only by their individual actions, that‚Äôs where individualism goes right

For instance judging people by the actions of someone else said action who‚Äôs not at all related to said persons and the points of separation are many isn‚Äôt justice since that person had nothing to do with said crime, it‚Äôs collective judgement and the most unjust things done, used by far-left groups like the Soviets, Nazis ect

Good thing those modernist idiots can‚Äôt do anything to stop the Traditional Latin Masses and Traditionalism, besides Traditionalism‚Äôs drastically growing globally and is expected to be the majority over the stupid Novas Ordo stupidity, no wonder they see just the existence of the Traditional Latin Mass a threat, people willingly choose the better Mass voluntary over the modernist stupidity

Pontifex fundamentum ac robur nostrum
Hominumque piscator pastor es gregis
Ligans Caelum et Terram
Petre, tu es Christi es Vicarius super Terram
Rupes inter fluctus, tu es pharus ac veritas
Tu Christi es caritas, tu es unitatis custos
Promptus libertatis defensor; in te auctoritas

I mean that stupid Novas Ordo rubbish is basically Protestantism with a catholic name tbh


[23-Jun-20 12:15 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Don't get me wrong I would prefer people be Christian than all those fake non-Christian "religions" because even protostants are following the Only Real faith and only real God even if with the partial truth and only partially being in the Spirit and not fully in the presence of God in the Holy Catholic Sacraments of Mass, Baptism, Confirmation, Penance, Anointing the Sick and last rights, Holy Orders, and marriage (Marriage to us is only recognized within the Holy Church between One man and One women to be considered a marriage)

[23-Jun-20 01:20 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@Aureate Baron what do u think


[23-Jun-20 01:27 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
I think they should but it should be done in a way that is respectful and proper of all Christian denominations to allow for Christian unity


[23-Jun-20 01:27 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Of course, I am a Catholic and Catholics believe in ecumenicalism


[23-Jun-20 01:33 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@Aureate Baron btw the plan of my pact is to unite Christian nations

[24-Jun-20 05:46 PM] Levi Ackerman#6726
S≈Çuchajcie, s≈Çuchajcie, mieszka≈Ñcy Khorinis!

Na rozkaz wielmo≈ºnego lorda Hagena og≈Çasza siƒô co nastƒôpuje.

W zwiƒÖzku z zaistnia≈ÇƒÖ sytuacjƒÖ dla w≈Çasnego bezpiecze≈Ñstwa, obywatele powinni unikaƒá las√≥w i bezdro≈ºy dooko≈Ça miasta co wiƒôcej zabrania siƒô kontakt√≥w ze zbuntowanymi wie≈õniakami.

Od chwili obecnej lord Andre przejmuje wy≈ÇƒÖczne dow√≥dztwo nad naszƒÖ stra≈ºƒÖ.

Wszyscy mieszka≈Ñcy kt√≥rzy posiadajƒÖ jakiekolwiek przeszkolenie w zakresie walki niech wstƒôpujƒÖ w szeregi stra≈ºy .

Wszelkie ≈õrodki bezpiecze≈Ñstwa dotyczƒÖce g√≥rnego miasta zostanƒÖ jeszcze bardziej zaostrzone.

Stra≈ºnicy strzegƒÖcy bram nie bƒôdƒÖ przepuszczaƒá nikogo kto nie posiada zezwolenia na wej≈õcie od miasta.

We wszystkich miastach i regionach kr√≥lestwa zostaje wprowadzony stan wojenny.

Sƒôdziowie cywilni zostajƒÖ pozbawieni swych praw a ich obowiƒÖzki przejmuj kr√≥lewscy paladyni.

Ka≈ºdy kto pope≈Çni≈Ç przestƒôpstwo lub sprzeciwi siƒô kr√≥lewskiej stra≈ºy podlega surowej krze.

EgzekucjƒÖ tego prawa zajmie siƒô wielmo≈ºny lord Andre.

Ka≈ºdy mieszkaniec Khorinis, kt√≥ry pope≈Çni≈Ç jakiekolwiek wykroczenie ma obowiƒÖzek zg≈Çosiƒá siƒô do lorda Andre.

W zwiƒÖzku z atakiem zagra≈ºajƒÖcym naszemu miastu ma obowiƒÖzek przygotowaƒá siƒô do walki tak jak pozwala mu jego stan majƒÖtkowy, dotyczy to zaopatrzenia siƒô w zbrojƒô i orƒô≈º, a tak≈ºe natychmiastowe rozpoczƒôcie treningu bojowego.

Ale Beliar nie znosi≈Ç widoku ≈õwiat≈Ça i niszczy≈Ç wszystko, co Innos stworzy≈Ç. Ujrza≈Ç wtedy Adanos, ≈ºe w ten spos√≥b nic nie mo≈ºe istnieƒá na ≈õwiecie: ani jasno≈õƒá, ani mrok. StanƒÖ≈Ç wiƒôc miƒôdzy swymi braƒámi i pr√≥bowa≈Ç pojednaƒá ich ze sobƒÖ. Jednak≈ºe bez skutku. Ale tam, gdzie stanƒÖ≈Ç Adanos, ani Innos, ani Beliar nie mieli ≈ºadnej w≈Çadzy.

Adanos cieszy≈Ç siƒô ze wszystkiego, co w√≥wczas powsta≈Ço, a swƒÖ mi≈Ço≈õciƒÖ darzy≈Ç jednakowo wszystkie rzeczy. Ale gniew Beliara by≈Ç tak wielki, ≈ºe przemierzy≈Ç on ca≈ÇƒÖ ziemiƒô, by znale≈∫ƒá bestiƒô. A gdy do niej przem√≥wi≈Ç, sta≈Ça siƒô ona jego s≈ÇugƒÖ. Beliar tchnƒÖ≈Ç w niƒÖ czƒô≈õƒá swej boskiej mocy, by mog≈Ça zniszczyƒá ca≈ÇƒÖ ziemiƒô. Ale Innos podpatrzy≈Ç czyn Beliara i przemierzy≈Ç ziemiƒô, by znale≈∫ƒá cz≈Çowieka. A gdy do niego przem√≥wi≈Ç, ten sta≈Ç siƒô jego s≈ÇugƒÖ. Innos tchnƒÖ≈Ç w niego czƒô≈õƒá swojej boskiej mocy, by m√≥g≈Ç on naprawiƒá szkody wyrzƒÖdzone przez Beliara. Wtedy zwr√≥ci≈Ç siƒô Beliar do innej istoty, ale Adanos zes≈Ça≈Ç potƒô≈ºnƒÖ falƒô, kt√≥ra zmy≈Ça jƒÖ z powierzchni ziemi. Ale wraz z niƒÖ odesz≈Çy tak≈ºe drzewa i zwierzƒôta, wiƒôc Adanos wielce siƒô zasmuci≈Ç. I rzek≈Ç wreszcie do swych braci: nigdy wiƒôcej nie postanie wasza noga na mojej ziemi, albowiem jest ona ≈õwiƒôta i pozostanie takƒÖ na wieki. Ale cz≈Çowiek i bestia nie zaprzestali wojny na ziemi Adanosa i p≈ÇonƒÖ≈Ç w nich gniew ich bog√≥w. A cz≈Çowiek pokona≈Ç bestiƒô, kt√≥ra wr√≥ci≈Ça do kr√≥lestwa Beliara. I zobaczy≈Ç Adanos, ≈ºe prys≈Ça r√≥wnowaga miƒôdzy ≈Çadem, a chaosem i zaklƒÖ≈Ç Innosa, by ten odebra≈Ç cz≈Çowiekowi swƒÖ boskƒÖ moc. A Innos w swej mƒÖdro≈õci tak uczyni≈Ç.

Discord goes off @ everyone inheritance. The mute role - will only execute properly if your inheritance is proper, which it isn't. All the roles should have the `/` permission under `Send Messages`, NOT the :success: . If you change all roles to `/` in the channel, and the everyone also has `/`, give the Muted role the :error: under `send messages` and you should be set.

[01-Jul-20 05:58 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
> Jacobins is not a leftist he some other shit that he made up u can
@Pope Benedict XV "The Jacobins supported the rights of property, but represented a much more middle-class position than the government which succeeded them in Thermidor. Their economic policy established the General maximum, in order to control prices and create stability both for the workers and poor and the revolution."


[01-Jul-20 05:58 AM] Tu Chin-Hei#1187
No


[01-Jul-20 05:58 AM] Mao Zedong#3925

Will make a lot more sense then nations rising and falling in the span of a few years, and include "average lifespans" to visualize the fact that inevitably everyone will have to get a fulltime job


[06-Jul-20 10:24 PM] MEE6#4876
GG @Cheif Alexios I Apokios, you just advanced to level 4!


[06-Jul-20 10:25 PM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
The age system will also make more sense, with noobs being kids in gamer years, and pros being old veterans


[06-Jul-20 11:11 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
That makes no sense

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC), the Church rejects all atheist and totalitarian ideologies but she also rejects all capitalist ideologies due the fact such ideals tend to value human labor as well as labor above the humanity of the individuals involved.


[09-Jul-20 10:54 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
Outright calling communism, marxism, capitalism, and individualism to be rejected by the Church because of the fact that she does recognize valuing human labor above all men and all virtue


[09-Jul-20 10:55 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) is the ultimate doctrine of the Catholic Church and outlines all ideals accepted and rejected. It is basically the official manifesto of the Church.

All catechisms are by nature fallible documents.

Are you denying the Infallibility of Catholicism and Catholic Doctrine?


[09-Jul-20 05:40 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Imagine people freely using their liberty and choosing to be traditionalists


[09-Jul-20 05:42 PM] FJ#1191
Well I am a right wing traditionalist.

Apparently to some the mere fact the Traditional Latin mass exists upsets them as one example (And studies show with the rapid growth of the Latin mass for good reason)

They must hate the fact people choose the Traditional Latin Mass and instead of understanding the marketplace of ideas and liberty to choose how to live and worship

Saying that the catechism is infallible is wrong.


[09-Jul-20 06:16 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Why is it wrong?


[09-Jul-20 06:16 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Because it is ‚ÄúCatholic‚Äù

@Bro. William


[09-Jul-20 06:17 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
You literally said that it was wrong.


[09-Jul-20 06:17 PM] Bro. William#8341
Saying something isn't infallible doesn't mean you're saying it's wrong/


[09-Jul-20 06:17 PM] Bro. William#8341
Theologians teach that the catechism is a fallible work of the ordinary magisterium


[09-Jul-20 06:18 PM] Bro. William#8341
Meaning it is subject to error


[09-Jul-20 06:18 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
So the Church is wrong?


[09-Jul-20 06:18 PM] Bro. William#8341
The Church doesn't declare doctrines through the catechism


[09-Jul-20 06:19 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
The Catechism is the official doctrine of the Church though


[09-Jul-20 06:19 PM] Bro. William#8341
She does it through the Pope in papal bulls, encyclicals, ect. or by the universal magisterium in the constant teaching of theologians

GG @Bro. William, you just advanced to level 2!


[09-Jul-20 06:19 PM] Bro. William#8341
The Catechism is not *the* official doctrine of the Church, it merely presents it as a teaching guide


[09-Jul-20 06:20 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
It is the teachings of the Church

[09-Jul-20 06:20 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Is what you are saying

Which is still a doctrine


[09-Jul-20 06:21 PM] Bro. William#8341
no


[09-Jul-20 06:21 PM] Bro. William#8341
not everything in the catechism is presented as a doctrine


[09-Jul-20 06:21 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
No, I am saying the whole thing


[09-Jul-20 06:21 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
It is the doctrine


[09-Jul-20 06:21 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Is presented as


[09-Jul-20 06:22 PM] Bro. William#8341
the catechism as a whole is "the doctrine"


[09-Jul-20 06:22 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Or pets of it are


[09-Jul-20 06:22 PM] Bro. William#8341
parts of it contain infallible teaching


[09-Jul-20 06:22 PM] Bro. William#8341
it's not infallible because it's in the catechism but because the Pope had already defined it as such


[09-Jul-20 06:22 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
What about the paragraph I cited


[09-Jul-20 06:23 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Is it ‚Äúnot infallible‚Äù


[09-Jul-20 06:23 PM] Bro. William#8341
are you familiar with theological notes


[09-Jul-20 06:25 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
No I am not


[09-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
I only really know basic things because I have like 4 religion textbooks and a bible


[09-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Bro. William#8341
there are different degrees or notes of teaching


[09-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Bro. William#8341
not everything that is true is a dogma


[09-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
But I am citing dogma


[09-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Regardless of it is true or accurate


[09-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
It is still something official stated


[09-Jul-20 06:27 PM] Bro. William#8341
what dogma did you cite


[09-Jul-20 06:27 PM] Bro. William#8341
these are all the dogmas of the Church, any teaching that falls out of these is not a dogma https://www.theworkofgod.org/dogmas.htm?fbclid=IwAR2sxlrN5GR53ButULDv9K5jbkbNBR3D9nkgyoxfbADa8E0gSYkAlG0qhAo#Dogma-IX-Baptism

[09-Jul-20 06:29 PM] Bro. William#8341
I agree with that paragraph


[09-Jul-20 06:30 PM] Bro. William#8341
but my point is that it's incorrect to say any catechism as a whole is infallible


[09-Jul-20 06:31 PM] Bro. William#8341
the Catechism of the Council of Trent, the Catechism of St. Pius X, the Baltimore Catechism are all fallible documents though they are good teaching guides


[09-Jul-20 06:32 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
There is truth that is infallible and unchangeable no matter how offensive to some


[09-Jul-20 06:33 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
This is true


[09-Jul-20 06:33 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
For instant the core of the Faith, Christ is God, and is the Son of God, and the only way to heaven is Through the Son of God's Church and no other fake religion, that's never going to change and most of us will never change our minds on it no mater what the modernists and universalists try to say


[09-Jul-20 06:34 PM] Bro. William#8341
right


[09-Jul-20 06:36 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Another truth more offensive to the leftists here is that marriage is a merely earthly invention and thus can be changed to appease to curtain groups, when infact Marriage is ONLY a Eternally bound sacrament between one man and one woman within God's Holy Church and all outside of that isn't recognized as a marriage (And us traditionalists will refuse to recognize anything else as a marriage no matter how offensive it is to sodomites, homosexuals, pogromists or other group)


[09-Jul-20 06:37 PM] Bro. William#8341
who are you referring to?


[09-Jul-20 06:37 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I'm referring to another set of doctrine that won't change no matter how much the modernists lothe it


[09-Jul-20 06:37 PM] Aureate Baron#3778

marriage ends at death of either one of the spouses


[09-Jul-20 06:38 PM] Baguette#3711
Agreed


[09-Jul-20 06:38 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Modernists will say that marriage is disposable and means nothing

Till death do you part yes but I mean it's not a merely earthly relationship but something that exists in the Supernatural church


[09-Jul-20 06:38 PM] Bro. William#8341
well yeah it's a sacrament


[09-Jul-20 06:39 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Especially after you go through with it

all the sacraments are divinely instituted

sure those lgbt activist types might live in a partnership or relationship but to us it's not a marriage and they can't force us to call it such

[09-Jul-20 06:40 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Yeah


[09-Jul-20 06:40 PM] Baguette#3711
We must also recognize that the average citizen in the western world doesn‚Äôt know a single sacrament

a lot of diocesan tribunals will just grant you a divorce even though you're still validly married to someonw

it's crazy

It is just very hard to do because they make the rules and doctrines clear

they don't really


[09-Jul-20 06:41 PM] Aureate Baron#3778

or a "beneplenist"


[09-Jul-20 06:43 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
she is the one who wanted to fornicate with Jesus and God

Yeah, she was a complete heretic


[09-Jul-20 06:44 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I mean Protestantism is basically an over glorified name for the most basic and childish sunday school teaching without any real theology or any deep thinking

are you a sedevacantist or beneplenist @Tom_TRW


[09-Jul-20 06:45 PM] Baguette#3711
In my school, a normal public school in a majority protestant country, we only learnt about Catholicism for a bout a week


[09-Jul-20 06:45 PM] Baguette#3711
12 years of school that is


[09-Jul-20 06:46 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
I am going to graduate from a Catholic high school and my grade school was also Catholic


[09-Jul-20 06:46 PM] Baguette#3711
There is no catholic high school of my knowledge in my country


[09-Jul-20 06:46 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
so I would will have about 13 years of Catholic education in 365 days


[09-Jul-20 06:46 PM] Bro. William#8341
catholic education is a rip off today


[09-Jul-20 06:46 PM] Bro. William#8341
in terms of teaching you the faith uncompromised


[09-Jul-20 06:47 PM] Bro. William#8341
academically they're better sure


[09-Jul-20 06:47 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
Indeed


[09-Jul-20 06:47 PM] Baguette#3711
Indeed, most Christian schools here, are normal schools that try to attract families with christian beliefs


[09-Jul-20 06:47 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
They are academically superior, but also superior with order and discipline


[09-Jul-20 06:47 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
they actively teach and enforce morality


[09-Jul-20 06:47 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
I do not know how public schools work, but from what I heard... they don't


[09-Jul-20 06:47 PM] Bro. William#8341
yeah id rather be in a catholic school than public


[09-Jul-20 06:48 PM] Bro. William#8341
they're still cesspools of impurity


[09-Jul-20 06:48 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
lol no, I'm a Traditionalist, the Catholic church doesn't have any ability to stop traditionalists from worshiping in Latin, and this Benny rp church has no authority since it's not a real Vatican or has authority in real life so Benny Can't tell us to stop celebrating the Traditional Latin mass


[09-Jul-20 06:48 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
It is like the preference of living in a slum or gated community


[09-Jul-20 06:48 PM] Baguette#3711
Disciplinary? No, most public schools do not work


[09-Jul-20 06:48 PM] Baguette#3711
Academically? It varies greatly


[09-Jul-20 06:48 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
you will probably be insulted and perhaps physically harassed in one


[09-Jul-20 06:48 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Well I'm going to go back to blowing stuff up in Just Cause 3, see ya around


[09-Jul-20 06:48 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
and in one you will probably be defended by others as well as the enforcement of a common code


[09-Jul-20 06:49 PM] Baguette#3711
May be


[09-Jul-20 06:49 PM] Aureate Baron#3778

and there is the fact that I get more out of the latter

so I would rather stick with private education


[09-Jul-20 06:50 PM] Bro. William#8341

homeschooling is the ideal nowadays

[09-Jul-20 06:51 PM] Tom_TRW#1610

homeschooling does not teach social virtue or values


[09-Jul-20 06:53 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Must be the autistic's playground


[09-Jul-20 06:53 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
so it lacks the ability to give people a social perspective on things


[09-Jul-20 06:54 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I would disagree I grew up homeschooled but I was very social (it depends on the people)


[09-Jul-20 06:54 PM] Baguette#3711

[09-Jul-20 06:55 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Debate Clubs, Choir, Civil Air Patrol, Competitive rowing (That was "Fun") but it forced me out of my bubble and taught me to not only be social but also consider other points of views and hold my own views in debates

GG @Tom_TRW, you just advanced to level 4!


[09-Jul-20 06:55 PM] Aureate Baron#3778
My experience differs, though that might be because the people who I knew to be homeschooled were very... unique... and open....


[09-Jul-20 06:56 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I can say homeschool jokes are often much more enjoyable by us homeschoolers than other people


[09-Jul-20 06:56 PM] Baguette#3711
Yes, people in my area that are homeschooled, are truly only schooled at home, no clubs or any sort if social grouping


[09-Jul-20 06:57 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
GG Pete, you turned out good despite that just gotta say


[09-Jul-20 07:00 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
Really the only group I was in every single year from 5 years old to when I graduated was a Private Christian choir group (mainly for homeschoolers) which yeah I saw all sorts of different types of home schoolers and did see some very awkward shy lads at one point or another.

It does depend, on one hand you could have a large Catholic family that does a lot of fiestas and parties, or a super strict family that is borderline cultists


[09-Jul-20 07:01 PM] Tom_TRW#1610
I normally put Christianity on a series of scales from Traditionalism to Very Protestant Fundamentalism, and those fundamentalists are "Fun" to debate at times

Ok, facist


[10-Jul-20 10:54 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Socialist


[10-Jul-20 10:54 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
I am a state socialist


[10-Jul-20 10:54 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
I can prove it to you


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] Baguette#3711
Oswald Mosley


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
The BUF denounced capitalism, with Mosley declaring: "Capitalism is a system by which capital uses the nation for its own purposes. Fascism is a system by which the nation uses capital for its own purposes".He went on to say "private enterprise is not permitted when it conflicts with national interests".


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Socialist


[10-Jul-20 10:59 AM] Baguette#3711
Alright, still facist


[10-Jul-20 10:59 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
National Syndicalist if you will


[10-Jul-20 10:59 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
He was extremely nationalistic


[10-Jul-20 10:59 AM] Baguette#3711
He was the leader of the BuF


[10-Jul-20 10:59 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
And a syndicalist


[10-Jul-20 10:59 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
> He was the leader of the BuF
@Baguette Yes, but fascism has many splinter ideologies, as does communism, capitalism, every ideology has splinter ideologies


[10-Jul-20 11:00 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
And his was a socialist variant


[10-Jul-20 11:00 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
He had far more leftist views than any other fascist in history


[10-Jul-20 11:00 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Sir Mosley


[10-Jul-20 11:00 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Yes?


[10-Jul-20 11:00 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Question


[10-Jul-20 11:00 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Shoot


[10-Jul-20 11:00 AM] Baguette#3711
Yes but his aim was to create a single organization for all parties with Facist views was it not?


[10-Jul-20 11:00 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Why are you so hesitant to be labeled as a Fascist?


[10-Jul-20 11:01 AM] Baguette#3711
after Sir Oswald's visits to Benito Mussolini, he became a facist


[10-Jul-20 11:01 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Your views seem similar to Mussolini


[10-Jul-20 11:01 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
> Why are you so hesitant to be labeled as a Fascist?
@Gated Reverb Fascism has gained such a negative flow of thoughts, that it is better not to be labelled as one


[10-Jul-20 11:01 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
So has Socialism


[10-Jul-20 11:01 AM] Baguette#3711
You may hold these views and policies, but I would suggest that these do not hold much value though, including both Socialism and Facism


[10-Jul-20 11:01 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
> after Sir Oswald's visits to Benito Mussolini, he became a facist
@Baguette Yes but even during the 30's, he went on talking about a socialist policy


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Baguette#3711
As did Mussolini


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Socialism has killed tens of millions of people


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Baguette#3711
A former Socialist


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Baguette#3711
But he was a facist


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
> Socialism has killed tens of millions of people
@Gated Reverb Communism and agrarianism did


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Not socialism


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Baguette#3711
Say that to Venezuela


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
^


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
And Nicaragua


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
> Say that to Venezuela
@Baguette They had a communist


[10-Jul-20 11:02 AM] Baguette#3711
And Communism is built upon socialist values


[10-Jul-20 11:03 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Yeah but they just took it too far


[10-Jul-20 11:03 AM] Danke#5334
OwO


[10-Jul-20 11:03 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Socialism is an invention of Marx, he meant it to be the step towards communism


[10-Jul-20 11:03 AM] Baguette#3711
Indeed


[10-Jul-20 11:03 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Communism, as suggested by it's name, is a system where everyone shares one thing. But in socialism, if one person gets something, everyone gets it


[10-Jul-20 11:03 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Which is what Hitler did


[10-Jul-20 11:04 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
> Yeah but they just took it too far
By that logic


[10-Jul-20 11:04 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
And I would never call him a communist


[10-Jul-20 11:04 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Which is why I am supportive of his economic policy


[10-Jul-20 11:04 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Fascism can also be simply viewed as having a few people take it too far


[10-Jul-20 11:04 AM] Baguette#3711
Well Hitler was not really a socialist, he only claimed to be because the name had positive associations


[10-Jul-20 11:04 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
He was a a Socialist?


[10-Jul-20 11:04 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
A national Socialist


[10-Jul-20 11:05 AM] Baguette#3711
He had backing form many business leaders and private organizations so


[10-Jul-20 11:05 AM] Baguette#3711
Well he used the name socialist


[10-Jul-20 11:05 AM] Baguette#3711
In the same way Sir Oswald would like to


[10-Jul-20 11:05 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Socialism is pretty much off compass at this point


[10-Jul-20 11:05 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Are you insinuating that I am a national socialist?


[10-Jul-20 11:05 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
It‚Äôs literally a hypothetical ideology


[10-Jul-20 11:05 AM] Baguette#3711
It was in reality far from socialist and Germany was never economically succesfull


[10-Jul-20 11:05 AM] Baguette#3711
For more than some years


[10-Jul-20 11:05 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
> Are you insinuating that I am a national socialist?
Yes sir


[10-Jul-20 11:06 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
You simply do not have the same views as Hitler on Eugenics


[10-Jul-20 11:06 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
But you are a National Socialist


[10-Jul-20 11:06 AM] Baguette#3711
Which no one should


[10-Jul-20 11:06 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
I am not supportive of eugenics


[10-Jul-20 11:06 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Allow me to say that now


[10-Jul-20 11:06 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Then you are an non-Nazi National Socialist


[10-Jul-20 11:06 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
I like that title


[10-Jul-20 11:07 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Let's stick with that


[10-Jul-20 11:07 AM] Baguette#3711
Well, it's negative in my mind


[10-Jul-20 11:07 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
The Nazi‚Äôs biggest crimes were committed due to Hitler‚Äôs belief in eugenics


[10-Jul-20 11:07 AM] Baguette#3711
Not the best associations


[10-Jul-20 11:07 AM] Baguette#3711
Indeed


[10-Jul-20 11:08 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
> Not the best associations
So is socialist


[10-Jul-20 11:08 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
I denounce the Hollocaust and Holodomor


[10-Jul-20 11:08 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
> So is socialist
@Gated Reverb So is capitalist


[10-Jul-20 11:08 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
So is monarchist


[10-Jul-20 11:08 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Exactly


[10-Jul-20 11:08 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
What is your point


[10-Jul-20 11:08 AM] Baguette#3711
I would disagree


[10-Jul-20 11:08 AM] MEE6#4876
GG @Baguette, you just advanced to level 4!


[10-Jul-20 11:08 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
There is no not bloodstained ideology


[10-Jul-20 11:08 AM] Baguette#3711
Capitalism has at least less of a negative association around it than communism


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
> I would disagree
@Baguette When you think about the US, do you think positive or negative things?


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Baguette#3711
Well the current state of the US is far from ideal


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
> Capitalism has at least less of a negative association around it than communism
@Baguette The key word is ***less***


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Not none


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Less


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
What matters is what an ideology is certain to lead to


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Baguette#3711
Indeed


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Capitalism will lead to greed


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
So you are agreeing with us


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Baguette#3711
But all ideologies and systems will have some people disagreeing with it


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
But not to our extent


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Baguette#3711
Which is their right


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Socialism will lead to Stalinistic Communism


[10-Jul-20 11:09 AM] Baguette#3711
Indeed


[10-Jul-20 11:10 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
> Socialism will lead to Stalinistic Communism
@Gated Reverb When you have Stalin running it yes


[10-Jul-20 11:10 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
I said


[10-Jul-20 11:10 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Stalinistic


[10-Jul-20 11:10 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Not Stalinist


[10-Jul-20 11:10 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
What is the difference?


[10-Jul-20 11:10 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
It‚Äôs the difference between hmm


[10-Jul-20 11:10 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Basically Maoist


[10-Jul-20 11:10 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Or agrarian if you will


[10-Jul-20 11:11 AM] Baguette#3711
Both have been humanitarian disasters


[10-Jul-20 11:11 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
Yeah


[10-Jul-20 11:11 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Stop Stalin with those proven to not work ideologies


[10-Jul-20 11:11 AM] Mao Zedong#3925
And Mao's over ambitions and poor planning


[10-Jul-20 11:11 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
Maoist, Castroist, Pol Potism, Kimism, Stalinism, Leninism, etc


[10-Jul-20 11:11 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
I view them all as Stalinistic ideologies, simply because Stalin is the best example


[10-Jul-20 11:11 AM] Baguette#3711
I would argue that the current status quo is far from ideal but its the least worst so far


[10-Jul-20 11:12 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
That‚Äôs fair


[10-Jul-20 11:12 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
But it definitely has its flaws


[10-Jul-20 11:12 AM] Baguette#3711
Indeed


[10-Jul-20 11:12 AM] Baguette#3711
I think it is fair to assume that all systems will have flaws though


[10-Jul-20 11:12 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
We must make the best of our circumstances


[10-Jul-20 11:12 AM] Baguette#3711

At least we‚Äôre not under that piece of shit in China


[10-Jul-20 11:13 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Socialism‚Äôs basically crony capitalism with state created monopolies where regulations and taxes kill off small businesses where only the big companies can survive and take that amount of stupid government over reach


[10-Jul-20 11:13 AM] Gated Reverb#1776
We should take measures to make sure we never end up there


[10-Jul-20 11:13 AM] Baguette#3711
Thank god for that

Never have I heard something more true about socialism


[10-Jul-20 11:13 AM] Baguette#3711
I must agree


[10-Jul-20 11:13 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
Basically in the socialist front capitalism the state chooses who wins or loses as well with unequal application of thier laws


[10-Jul-20 11:14 AM] Gated Reverb#1776

@Tom_TRW That's why it's the greatest

[10-Jul-20 11:19 AM] Baguette#3711
Of course some regulation is needed to stop an "overgrowth" of monopolies, for a lack of a better word, but the state can't really bring down corporations either I beleive


[10-Jul-20 11:31 AM] Tom_TRW#1610
What about that fake religion? If you think about it the higher the taxes bigger companies with a bigger profit margin are able to absorb them while small companies would be forced out of business so in actuality it would lead to government made monopolies defeating the point

[12-Jul-20 08:04 PM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
if you get any injury that would wound you, you cannot use that character in combat until you would realistically be able to stop for medical help (eg, not those levels where the next one leaves off after the other, but the ones like when you are on coruscant after the speeder chase level)


[12-Jul-20 08:05 PM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
if you get a lethal injury (eg. a droideka shoots you in the face or you fall in lava) on a character that does not cannonically die in that level you restart the episode

Germany would be the "new US" in terms of cultural dominance probably


[04-Aug-20 06:25 AM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
and monarchism would be much more mainstream


[04-Aug-20 06:26 AM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
and maybe the US would not take it's free speech and democracy for granted anymore as those values would not be as common as they are in this timeline


[04-Aug-20 06:27 AM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
(would not be north korea bad because age of enlightenment, but would be more along the lines of moderately less democratic then the UK nowdays probably)


[04-Aug-20 06:45 AM] Foliamane#3308
I also think people would have stayed with religion


[04-Aug-20 06:46 AM] Foliamane#3308

if the ottomans lost at varna Rome might survive as a tiny state to this day

or be part of the bulgarian or serb empires


[07-Aug-20 08:07 PM] superiorob#1422
it would probably survive as a city state like the vatican


[07-Aug-20 08:08 PM] superiorob#1422
not as small ofc since constantinople is large but still small

Well, is france won the 7 years war, then I believe the French Revolution wouldnt have happened. The British would've been weakened in the Americas and most likely lead to the American Revolution as in our timeline. Most of the nations in Eastern Europe wouldnt have been affected. Prussia would have either, not gained any territories such as Posen, or they would have lost lands to Austria and Russia. 

But now that I'm thinking.... A French Revolution might have occured but it would have gone way differently. If the revolution were to have occured, and with the Republicans winning, the Borbouns would most likely have gone exile into their colonies in Quebec and continue their Kingdom and legacy from there

Yea, the French Revolution was going to happen anyways. It was already planned out for a while by the Free Masons.


[10-Aug-20 11:04 AM] „ÄéùêìùêÜùêà„ÄèEmperor Karl I#7597
The Free Masons are very Anti-Catholic and Anti-Monarchy. I remember one time in Ecuador, a President was going to hire a Spanish Prince and make Ecuador a Monarchy. Until the Masons assasinated him.

[13-Aug-20 02:35 PM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
some of the votes the line of resistance had may have been invalid


[13-Aug-20 02:36 PM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
we did not say anything at first because we wanted to investigate it without letting them know we suspect them


[13-Aug-20 02:36 PM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
but since everyone is crying corruption had to come clean


[13-Aug-20 02:37 PM] Carl7042#3710
I think you should have waited before announcing results and declared the winner after investigating


[13-Aug-20 02:38 PM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
we had a deadline


[13-Aug-20 02:38 PM] Carl7042#3710
You could have mentioned an investigation is in progress and results are delayed


[13-Aug-20 02:39 PM] Foliamane#3308
They are trying to stop our party because they know we are the best for the people


[13-Aug-20 02:41 PM] Cheif Alexios I Apokios#6212
we are just trying to make sure everyone plays fair

I believe the discord nations aren‚Äôt just tribes however, they haven‚Äôt created some huge way to interconnect which needs to be made. Like a UN of sorts to bring more peace to discord


[21-Aug-20 08:05 PM] Freedom Phantom#7164
However all the communist/socialist and fascist servers should be excluded and destroyed


[21-Aug-20 08:05 PM] Freedom Phantom#7164

But yes, I believe if a huge UN style group was created (though it would take a while to get enough nations in) then they could stop most of discord warfare through peaceful means. Though a lot of peacekeepers would be sent. Discord warfare will never likely 100% end but I believe most of it can end


[21-Aug-20 08:12 PM] Freedom Phantom#7164
But not before I yeet the Communist nations


[21-Aug-20 08:13 PM] Danke#5334

The Nazis and commies are also on roblox

How normies see Ethiopia: ha ha funny africans with spears
How people who actually know history see Ethiopia: Absolute chads, defended Christendom in east africa for over 1000 years, threatened to cut off the flow of the nile if Egypt did not stop opressing it's Christians
Kind of "odd" how whenever the left tells everyone to learn about pre-european african culture, they always go to the steryotype of the southern/central african tribes, never touching on the Christian states of east africa

Catholics and Orthodox need to work together. We are closer than we think. The protestants, jews and islamists are the enemy.

> Say we are equal then we shall have peace
What is peace?


[24-Aug-20 04:16 PM] Nicholas Nikolaevich#7335
In my opinion it is, Orthodoxy is better but that doesn't mean I'm not willing to put differences aside to work with Catholic brethren.


[24-Aug-20 04:16 PM] Tolgus (not Sad)#5940
All I know is war and religion war


[24-Aug-20 04:17 PM] Tolgus (not Sad)#5940

Lmao.


[24-Aug-20 04:18 PM] Ante Paveliƒá#2555
Nicholas you say we must "put aside our differences" Serbs are the enemies of me of the Croats at every chance they try to dismantle the nation of Croatia and we fight back and are labeled evil they are orthodox therefore the orthodox are the enemy


[24-Aug-20 04:19 PM] Tolgus (not Sad)#5940
I don't think bcs a nation does a bad thing means the religion is bad too


[24-Aug-20 04:19 PM] Nicholas Nikolaevich#7335
...I never said Serbs were good.


[24-Aug-20 04:20 PM] Ante Paveliƒá#2555
Serbs are orthodox


[24-Aug-20 04:20 PM] Nicholas Nikolaevich#7335
Doesn't mean I agree with them, and most of them are heretics due to their sect's dogma.


[24-Aug-20 04:20 PM] Tolgus (not Sad)#5940
So serbs are dogs


[24-Aug-20 04:20 PM] Tolgus (not Sad)#5940
