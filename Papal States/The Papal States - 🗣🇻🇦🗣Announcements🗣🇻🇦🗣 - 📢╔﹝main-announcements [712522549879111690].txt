Sorry for the ping but this is an important announcement from the discord team

[24-May-20 07:25 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@everyone Please read this carefully A fair warning, Look out for a Discord user by the name of 𝓘𝔃𝔃𝔂 with the tag #2911. She is going around sending friend requests to random Discord users, and those who accept her friend requests will have their accounts DDoSed and their groups exposed with the members inside it becoming a victim as well. Spread the word and send this to as many Discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept her friend request and immediately block her. Our team is currently working very hard to remove this user from our database. Please stay safe. -Discord team 
Copy and paste this to all the servers you are in

@everyone ^ imp

[31-May-20 06:01 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@everyone There is a new Discord Trojan attack going around where it logs you out of Discord and you have to log back in. Once you log back in, it then has access to your account and user tokens.
With this information, it is disabling 2FA and locking the user out of their accounts. It then attempts to log into your linked accounts, such as YouTube, Twitch, Steam, etc.. If you use the same password for these accounts, then it will likely be successful in doing that.
This Trojan is being passed around disguised as a link to a game.
If you download this fake game,during its install process it will modify the Discord JS files instructing Discord to load up a couple of extra scripts that convert your password into plain text that it can then harvest. This is why it logs you out and you are required to log back in.
To prevent this from happening, do not download any software at all that has been passed to your Discord.
If you have downloaded anything recently and you have been logged out of Discord, do not log back in. Instead, uninstall Discord and re-install it from the official discord website.
This does not affect the Web Browser version.
It has recently been covered by multiple websites; see the Forbes article below.
The article below describes how you can check your own installation for the presence of this malware. It isn't hard; a single line in one file should tell you if you are infected. Read below for instructions:

Gamers Beware: Stealthy Malware Steals Your Discord Password And At...
Today, Discord has 250 million registered users and around 15 million of them active on any given day... which is why it’s become a popular target for cybercriminals.

@everyone Do NOT accept friend requests from bobyblobfish#1566 He is a hacker. Tell everyone on your friends list because if somebody on your list adds one of them, they'll be on your list too. He will figure out your personal computer's IP and address by just befriending, so copy & paste this message wherever you can. He is going around sending friend requests to random discord users, and those who accept his requests will have their accounts and their IP Addresses revealed to him by just accepting a friend request. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately block him. -Discord Team

Dear people, Elections are postponed and the date shall be discussed due to some issues in the Elections and due to some parties cheating. This might be harsh but we might be reducing the number of parties to 4 or 5 and might also be abolishing Radical parties. Basically the plan is to reduce chaos and the state shall be making few parties such as (social democratic party/democratic socialist Party, God's Party, Monarchist party, Democratic Party) our plan is to basically reduce the extremism and to reduce chaos this might also reduce the options for the Elections but we added parties from both the left and right. This plan is still being discussed so stay tuned. @👨‍👩‍👧‍👦Papal Citizens👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

[04-Jul-20 12:31 PM] Grilo#1847
Salve Everyone i got an annoucement. 
The BLUE WHALE CHALLENGE is back, this is a serious issue and countless people have died/ put their life at risk. These people know your IP address and who your family/loved ones are.

How do I stay safe
I understand many of you would be scared of this issue, but I will give you some life saving steps to save you.
• DO NOT accept any FRIEND REQUESTS from ANYONE.
• DO turn off your DMs if you can, if you can't, please follow the above step.
• The challenge starts off with them asking you to play a game. Do not reply to them and block them and report them IMMEDIATELY
• Please do not try and joke with them as A SINGLE DM is all it takes for them to get your information. 

Is it only happening on discord?
No, it is happening on all social media platforms, the main person who will DM you is someone by the name of Jonathan Galindo.

What happens?
If you say yes to their games, they will challenge you to do 50 things. Each challenge gets more disturbing as it goes on. They ask for picture evidence and if you don't give it they come for you and your family. The 50th challenge is.... to kill yourself... As you can see this is serious and shouldn't be taken lightly. I guess you could say this is the Momo challenge again but this time with real consequences.

and finally, please DO NOT even joke with them. They are serious! People have seriously died from this challenge!
Be safe everyone!

@here **I as your Holy Pope Pius XI will Resign next week, as of course my inactivity has been noticed but my diplomacy with our friends has been known widely. I want to say this, I always wanted a crusade but to be honest what I really wanted was not a Holy War but Equality Set amongst every man, woman, and child in the Papal States. I always was an accepting Bishop and no matter if your gay, trans, or an attack helicopter God will still love you. It breaks my heart that I have to do this but it’s only for the best of the church and the future of Rome. Thank you and God bless you all.**

May 30th, 1914, Southern Italy was bought under the fold of the Papal States. Papal Casualties: 20,000, Scandinavian Casualties(our allies @Deleted User's nation ) : 25,000 , Naples's (owns whole of south Italy at that time) : 31,000. hence winning the war, the Pope sparred the lives of all napaleese citizens and gave them papal Citizenship and released all POW. This news was highly appreciated by the napaleese people and the nations of Europe.

[18-Jul-20 11:43 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
We are planning to make south Italy a seperate place(a seperate category which includes factories, a new place to build properties and a new place to talk with fellow citizens of the papal states) every 2 weeks elections will be held for a legate(governor) for Naples hence making a role called "Naples resident" this won't seperate the people and they can vote in elections for legate(governor) of Rome as all Napal residents have Papal Citizenship. 

Do you support this?

I will keep you up to date on the holy battle going on. Our glorious pope has marched alone with this opening statement.

Sadly, our server owner is becoming more passive and is allowing the enemy to speak their obviously flawed arguments without much restriction.

[01-Aug-20 05:52 AM] superiorob#1422
We will have to take the battle for ourselves, our pope has proved not fit for this.

[01-Aug-20 05:52 AM] superiorob#1422
Charge.

[01-Aug-20 06:00 AM] Alexios VI(In Exile)#6212
We will provide screenshots of what happened past this point when we are finished

[01-Aug-20 06:27 AM] superiorob#1422
There was a lapse in the fighting, and we turned around the battle without the help of our pope.

[01-Aug-20 06:27 AM] superiorob#1422
A glorious victory for our nation!

[01-Aug-20 06:29 AM] superiorob#1422

Everyone kind of agrees with me, but the line of resistance did not vote for some odd reason

[13-Aug-20 03:40 PM] Alexios VI(In Exile)#6212
They are likely trying to frame staff claiming we deleted their votes

[13-Aug-20 03:40 PM] Alexios VI(In Exile)#6212
