***What do you think of Pope Benedict XV specifically?***

*I believe he has been the greatest leader for our nation and should never step down. -* :Coat_of_arms_of_the_Papal_States: 

*I think he has good intentions, but is ultimately too goofy for the position of owner right now, he is not a bad owner necessarily, but is not serious enough for the job in wartime. Good, but not great by any means. -* :Ugandan_Thonk:

*I think he has been a bad, too goofy for his own good, lackluster leader and he should step down immediately for the sake of the nation. -* :Benedict_aint_amused: 

*I am neutral. -* :Come_Here_You:
