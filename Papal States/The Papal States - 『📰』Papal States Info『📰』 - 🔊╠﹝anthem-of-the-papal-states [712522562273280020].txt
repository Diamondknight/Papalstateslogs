O felix Roma – o felix Roma nobilis

O felix Roma, Roma felix, Roma nobilis

Sedes es Petri, qui Christi vicem gerit

Sedes es Petri, qui apostolus est pacis

 

Pontifex tecum erimus omnes nos

Pontifex es magister qui tuos confirmas fratres

Pontifex tecum erimus omnes nos

Pontifex es magister qui tuos confirmas fratres

Pontifex fundamentum ac robur nostrum

Hominumque piscator pastor es gregis

Ligans Caelum et Terram

 

Petre, tu es Christi es Vicarius super Terram

Rupes inter fluctus, tu es pharus ac veritas

Tu Christi es caritas, tu es unitatis custos

Promptus libertatis defensor; in te auctoritas

 

Petre, tu es Christi es Vicarius super Terram

Rupes inter fluctus, tu es pharus ac veritas

Tu Christi es caritas, tu es unitatis custos

Promptus libertatis defensor; in te auctoritas

 

O Roma nobilis – o Roma felix nobilis```

```__**🇬🇧English Lyrics🇬🇧**__

O happy Rome - O noble Rome

You are the seat of Peter, who shed his blood in Rome,

Peter, to whom the keys of the kingdom of heaven were given.

Pontiff, You are the successor of Peter;

 

Pontiff, You are the teacher,

You confirm your brethren;

Pontiff, You are the teacher,

You confirm your brethren.

Pontiff, You who are the Servant of the servants of God,

and fisher of men, are the shepherd of the flock,

linking heaven and earth.

 

Pontiff, You are the vicar of Christ on earth,

a rock amidst the waves, You are a beacon in the darkness;

You are the defender of peace, You are the guardian of unity,

watchful defender of liberty; in You is the authority.

 

Pontiff, you are the unshakable rock, and on this rock

was built the Church of God.

Pontiff, You are the vicar of Christ on earth,

a rock amidst the waves, You are a beacon in the darkness;

You are the defender of peace, You are the guardian of unity,

watchful defender of liberty; in You is the authority.

 

O happy Rome - O noble Rome.```
