Dear members of the Curia, i propose a change in the administration. I am going to talk about the @—Legates— (governors) but I am not sure about what more power should the legates should have. Could you suggest few things if you agree with giving the legates more power. @—God's Party— @—International Monarchist Party— @—National Unionist Party of the Papal States— @—United Right Wing— @—United Libertarian Front(left-wing)— @—National Unity Party—
