__**Loans**__

Well, you just ping me, and ask for a quantity of money.

•100 - You will need to pay 150 (1 week irl to pay)
•500 - You will need to pay 600 (2 weeks irl to pay)
•1000 - You will need to pay 1150 (2 weeks irl to pay)
•2500 - You will need to pay 2200 (3 weeks irl to pay)
•3000 - You will need to pay 4000 (4 weeks irl to pay)
•No.+000+ - You will need to pay No.+150 (4 weeks irl to pay) [ex: 4300 = 4450]
•No.+500+ - You will need to pay No.+200 (4 weeks irl to pay) [ex: 4550 = 4750]

Just ping @superiorob  to give you the loan, and you will have your money

**Note**
If you don't give the money back you shall be warned every 2 days (3 warnings total) you shall be put in court and tried (I know it's difficult but thats how stuff works irl)

[12-Jul-20 10:41 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
@superiorob the College of cardinals are shrinking we need to restart the school and also give a retest to the cardinal deacons and select the best into cardinals

[12-Jul-20 10:41 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
You can grow

[12-Jul-20 10:42 AM] superiorob#1422
Oh ok

[12-Jul-20 10:42 AM] superiorob#1422
