We supplicate you, Almighty God, effect your customary devotion and pour out on this your servant, Pope Pius XI , the grace of the Holy Spirit that he who is constituted at the head of our church as the servant of the mystery, you would strengthen with the fullness of virtue.

[05-Jun-20 09:41 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
God, who willed your Apostle Peter to hold first place in the inner fellowship of the apostles, that universal Christianity overcome evil, look propitiously we ask on this your servant, Pope Pius XI , who from a humble position has suddenly been enthroned with the apostles on this same principal sublimity, that just as he has been raised to this exalted dignity, so may he likewise merit to accumulate virtue; in bearing the burden of the universal church, help him, make him worthy and for thee who are blessed may merits replace vices.

[05-Jun-20 09:41 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Accept the pallium, representing the plenitude of the Pontifical office, to the honour of Almighty God, and the most glorious Virgin Mary, his Mother, and the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and the Holy Roman Church Pope Pius XI

[05-Jun-20 09:42 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Do you accept the pallium Pius XI
Pius XI : Yes, I do

[05-Jun-20 09:43 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Accipe tiaram tribus coronis ornatam, et scias te esse patrem principum et regum, rectorem orbis in terra vicarium Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi, cui est honor et gloria in saecula saeculorum.¬†Receive the tiara adorned with three crowns, and know that you are the father of princes and kings, the ruler of the world, the vicar of our Savior Jesus Christ on earth, to whom be all honor and glory, world without end.

Come by me and listen to the crusade report, christian folks!


Our scouts spotted a muslim barbaric country,
Then the almighty pope gave the signal to attack in the name of the omnipotent Father!
We left no one alive and missioned many of them,
Slaves were taken mosques were burnt.
The crusade for the holy Lord was a success!
