**does horse riding thing**

[01-Jul-20 12:05 AM] Alexios VI(In Exile)#6212
Perhaps the military could be made to join in on helping us get partners?

[01-Jul-20 12:05 AM] Alexios VI(In Exile)#6212
It is currently sitting idle right now.

[01-Jul-20 12:05 AM] superiorob#1422
yeah, our military has been rather inactive

[01-Jul-20 12:06 AM] superiorob#1422
we havent done much

[01-Jul-20 12:06 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Ehhhh nah we need generals who are active

[01-Jul-20 12:06 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
That's the only thing we need

[01-Jul-20 12:06 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I will ping my generals to start training now

[01-Jul-20 12:06 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I will take care of the swiss guard

[01-Jul-20 12:06 AM] superiorob#1422
could i be of good use as a general?

[01-Jul-20 12:06 AM] superiorob#1422
oh

[01-Jul-20 12:06 AM] superiorob#1422
dang

[01-Jul-20 12:06 AM] Alexios VI(In Exile)#6212
How would an active one rise in rank when the common soldiers have no battles to achieve glory in?

[01-Jul-20 12:07 AM] superiorob#1422
indeed, we cannot expect our generals to be competent if we do not have anything to show for them

[01-Jul-20 12:07 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Hm

[01-Jul-20 12:07 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
We will see about that I gotta talk to them first and we got enough people doing the partnerships already

[01-Jul-20 12:08 AM] Alexios VI(In Exile)#6212
ita

[01-Jul-20 12:08 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Mhm

[01-Jul-20 12:08 AM] superiorob#1422
personally, myself and ferrum could be active generals, we met on minecraft, and he is excellent at strategizing and pvp, this could be useful over on discord, too

[01-Jul-20 12:09 AM] superiorob#1422
so if you ever need a general for our cavalry, i reccommend him.

[01-Jul-20 12:09 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Mate u already are handling alot are u sure you want to do this?

[01-Jul-20 12:09 AM] superiorob#1422

[01-Jul-20 12:26 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Oof

[01-Jul-20 12:29 AM] superiorob#1422

[01-Jul-20 12:29 AM] superiorob#1422
