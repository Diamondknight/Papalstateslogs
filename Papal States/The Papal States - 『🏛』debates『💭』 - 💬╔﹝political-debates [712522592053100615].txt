Both are equally poor choices

[30-Jun-20 08:53 AM] Aureate Baron#3778
But for entirely separate reasons

Politicians are always crap

[30-Jun-20 03:41 PM] Zenator#3289
Also 
it's so fucking ironic
people call bernie a communist
for stuff that has been normal in other countries for decades

[30-Jun-20 11:09 PM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Bernie is merely a socialist he is not a radical

[30-Jul-20 10:01 AM] superiorob#1422
Bernie isn’t even a socialist I’d say

[30-Jul-20 10:01 AM] superiorob#1422
He’s regular but has socialist factors in his policies

[30-Jul-20 10:01 AM] superiorob#1422
Doesnt make him a commie imo

[31-Jul-20 08:09 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
He is a socialist sort of but not a communist
