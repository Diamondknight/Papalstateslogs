[30-Jul-20 02:32 PM] Alexios VI(In Exile)#6212
It has elections and a mock political system, I intend to take a unit of crusaders and gain political hegemony there, thus securing a personal union for us

[30-Jul-20 02:33 PM] Alexios VI(In Exile)#6212
which means they could be a partner, if you are watching pope

[30-Jul-20 02:35 PM] Alexios VI(In Exile)#6212
