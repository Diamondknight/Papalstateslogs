1. How did you join the server, where did you find the invite. I found it via a partnership.

2. What do you say when you see the Pope or Lord? Glory to the state, Glory to the pope, ave Maria.

3. What are your intentions of joining the server? To gain a position in the church and institute Catholicism in my nation, the Kingdom of Ireland.

4. What is the 2nd rule? Never ping members of the administration, DM if you want to report things.

5. Would you like to be a student and perhaps join our administration? I would like to get a position in the church, yes.

6. Would you like to join our military? No thank you.

The Apostles' Creed
I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.

I believe in Jesus Christ, God’s only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again; he ascended into heaven, he is seated at the right hand of the Father, and he will come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

1. Italy 
2. What do you say when you see

When speaking to High Ranks (Minister and above in politics, top 4 ranks below Generals and Admirals in military):
Instead of "Yes", say "ita"
Instead of "No", say "Nihil"
Instead of "Yes Sir!", say "ita Domine!"
Instead of "Sir", say "Domine"
Respect everyone regardless of their ranks.
When you see @Pope Benedict XV @lilKing typing in chat:
Say "Glory to the state, Glory to the pope, ave Maria"
Don't argue with the pope you can only give him advise and suggestions.
When you talk to members of the @—🗝️⛪🗝️College Of Cardinals🗝️⛪🗝️— you have to call them as 'monsigneur'
