Starting sack of rome

[28-May-20 02:05 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904

[28-May-20 02:07 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
"dear soldiers today those misbelievers are at our gates, today it's the day where you show your loyalty to the mother church, today brothers we stand together,fight together and die together! AVE MARIA!!!!"

[28-May-20 02:08 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
swiss guard soldiers, "Deus Vult!!!"

[28-May-20 02:08 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
*cannon fires*

[28-May-20 02:08 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Rest you can do all by yourself with the enemy soldiers

[28-May-20 02:08 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
The acting you want

[28-May-20 02:08 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And then when I see that we are losing

[28-May-20 02:09 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
I sing the anthem and you just have to act that you are encouraged and continue fighting

[28-May-20 02:09 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
Then the marshal anyone of you shall take me away while fighting and taking 2 bullets to yourself

[28-May-20 02:10 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
And cannon fires all around you

[28-May-20 02:10 AM] Pope Benedict XV#0904
The end
